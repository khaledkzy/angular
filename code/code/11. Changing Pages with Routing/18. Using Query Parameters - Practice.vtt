00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.250
In the last lecture we had a child routeing Let's improve this app a little bit more in our service

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.300
component.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.900
We have links loading to individual servers.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:21.540
So the single server component this component here with does allow added query parameter so now any

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.230
server component we should add some button where we say added server because right now we get no way

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.810
of reaching the edits or component.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.880
Besides manually typing this route here just your into your hour you are l.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.590
So let's add a button to the service component.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.140
I'll add some see as those classes to make this look nice and of course I'll add a click listener where

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.670
I say on add it again does this on a single server component.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.770
So here are add on added method.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.170
And in here I now want to navigate to the added server component.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.090
We learned how to do this we need to get access to the router so that we are able to call the navigate

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.830
method.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.950
So let's inject it.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.710
Make sure to also add to import from an Anglo router.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.720
And with that injected in on adults we can navigate you'll learn how to Judus So maybe a time to pause

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.430
the video and try it on your own.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.770
This is how I would do it.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.340
I would call my router.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.630
Then of course we have to navigate Methot And here we need to pass an array and we simply want to append

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.910
add it to the end of the currently loaded route.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.980
So you could of course also use slash servers the relative path then use the idea of the currently roaded

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.090
loaded server again server ID and then append edit.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.110
But since we already are on this path why not just use a relative route and just use edit.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.280
Now you've learned if you want to use a relative router relative pop here when using the navigator method

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.810
you need to set up the relative to property here on the second argument on this object you can pass

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.770
to navigate and referenced the currently loaded route so that the angler router knows to which route

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.630
you want to navigate relatively.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.280
So with this we should load the slash EDID route we should append it to the end of our currently loaded

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.230
route.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.540
Let's see if this works if we go to servers click on a server and click on edit.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.520
We load the edit server page.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.870
And now here we want to control on where the user is allowed to update to edit the server or not.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:53.600
The issue is you see we theoretically have our equerry presence here a low edit always said to one in

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.190
this case but we lose this information as soon as we click Edit server.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.520
So that is something we need to fix before we can use the information there.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.010
We will fix that in the next lecture before doing so let's implement the rest of the logic though let's

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.740
say here on the service component where we set the allow added query parameter we don't always want

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.530
to set this to 1 to true.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.480
Therefore we want to decide on whether we want to allow the editing depending on the server ID lets

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.170
say.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:32.120
So only if the server ID equals free let's say only in this case we want to allow edits we want to set

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.010
it to 1 otherwise we will set it to zero.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.260
So that's just a ternary expression.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.570
Checking the server ID and if it's not equal to free will set it to zero.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.430
So we will set the allow added parameter to zero.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.950
That's the first step.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.320
Now an added server of course we you want to be able to retrieve our Querrey perhaps.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.700
So here we already get to subscribe method on the Querrey prims.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.450
Now here I want to determine on whether we are allowed to edit or not.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:08.130
So I will add a new allow added property here and set it to false either initially but whenever this

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.820
changes here in the query parameters I want to get my query parents which are all of type parents to

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.400
be imported from an Anglo router.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:29.790
And then here in the method body I will set this allow added equal to my query per Elmes year equal

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.590
tudy allow added ID or property we set there.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:42.210
And now this ever is one string of one of course you get all the past through as a string here in which

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.340
case I want to set allow edit to true if it is not one I will set it to false though.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:58.020
And in the template of this component we could simply add a heading let's say where we say your not

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:07.940
allowed to edit if then you can use NGF for this if allow added is false so if not allow added and we

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.450
wrap all the rest in a new div.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.380
So all this part you're only if it is true.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.930
And now all of a sudden we would control this.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.150
But again the issue is if you click on edit server or equerry programs disappear.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.470
So it is always Indeed you're not allowed to edit mode.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.160
Let's fix it in the next lecture.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.510
Let's see how we can actually preserve our equerry parents once we navigate again.
