00:02.280 --> 00:06.980
In the last lecture we added this navigation and I also mention dead.

00:06.990 --> 00:10.680
You can change the way you use your posture.

00:10.680 --> 00:17.220
Right now we use slash slash service or even with these more complex notation we have Slash users as

00:17.230 --> 00:18.870
the first element.

00:18.870 --> 00:24.800
Now what happens if we just use servers here like this and just use users like this.

00:24.990 --> 00:27.960
Let's save this without deleting slash.

00:27.960 --> 00:34.660
Now if we click there on our links you'll still see this works absolutely fine.

00:34.710 --> 00:36.630
Nothing changed.

00:36.630 --> 00:41.390
Now let's go to our service component template file here.

00:41.750 --> 00:45.470
And for now let's quickly add anchor tela element here.

00:45.840 --> 00:54.110
Where we also add a router link where I add servers again reload page would be a fitting description.

00:54.120 --> 00:59.040
So on the service component I now edit this router link where I basically want to make sure that I stay

00:59.040 --> 01:01.340
on the service page which I'm already on.

01:01.620 --> 01:08.820
So if you go to service here we see the reload page here if I click it you'll see we got an error this

01:08.820 --> 01:14.790
error here ochreous because it doesn't find a route which is service slash servers.

01:14.790 --> 01:20.450
Now this error won't occur if on the service component I turned this to slash service.

01:20.490 --> 01:25.500
So to an absolute path it was a relative path here.

01:25.540 --> 01:32.550
If we now have our console still open and I click reload page nothing of course nothing no arrow Chris

01:32.850 --> 01:37.950
because now it simply navigates to a local host 4200 slash service.

01:37.950 --> 01:45.180
As you can see down there and if we turned this back to a relative path the difference was that now

01:45.330 --> 01:48.280
it tries to go slash service service.

01:48.300 --> 01:55.150
So with a relative path it always depends upon if you specify any route or link to the end of your current

01:55.160 --> 01:55.840
path.

01:55.920 --> 02:00.450
And important year the current path depends on which component you are currently on.

02:00.450 --> 02:07.500
That is why we could remove that in our navigation where we also use relative povs because that isn't

02:07.500 --> 02:08.910
our route component.

02:08.970 --> 02:11.550
This component is not loaded through the router.

02:11.580 --> 02:17.990
So this route component always sits at local host 4200 slash nothing.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.760
So this is always at our rude level which is why we can use relative povs here too.

02:24.090 --> 02:30.240
But one layer below that once we loaded a route for example the service component This page is only

02:30.240 --> 02:32.640
loaded if we are at slash service.

02:32.700 --> 02:38.340
So if we add a relative route here this will now get appended to this route we are on.

02:38.340 --> 02:45.210
So we'll try to load service slash service and therefore it gives us an error in our case because we

02:45.210 --> 02:49.350
haven't registered a service slash service route.

02:49.380 --> 02:56.220
Now of course using relative spot relative POS inside of active components active routes might be a

02:56.220 --> 02:58.720
nice thing if you have nested routes.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.620
Right now it will only break the app though.

03:01.710 --> 03:05.560
Now you can also use relative povs with dot slash at the beginning.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.870
This is the same as having nothing there.

03:08.250 --> 03:15.990
And you can even navigate around like in a folder directory you could at dot dot slash which means go

03:16.050 --> 03:22.170
up one level and then used at this to the lbf here.

03:22.170 --> 03:28.710
Now if we do this inside of our a service component you will see by hover over this now it again only

03:28.710 --> 03:36.300
tries to load slash servers and therefore we don't see an error because now it first goes back one level

03:36.360 --> 03:42.960
which basically is to just our route pauvres so it removes one Poth and important part depends on the

03:42.960 --> 03:44.030
route you're on.

03:44.040 --> 03:51.200
So if you were on servers slash something and this would load this component it would remove both.

03:51.360 --> 03:57.960
So this does not necessarily only remove one segment here it removes the currently loaded segment you

03:57.960 --> 03:58.600
could say.

03:58.710 --> 04:04.770
So in this case it removes this and then adds slash service again which is why this works and that is

04:04.770 --> 04:10.560
how you can navigate around absolute paths with a slash at the beginning which will always get appended

04:10.560 --> 04:18.300
to the root domain relative povs without a slash or with dot slash which means added to the currently

04:18.300 --> 04:27.050
loaded Poth or dot dot slash and you can even add more of them to say well go back ones path go back

04:27.170 --> 04:28.280
another path.

04:28.320 --> 04:35.070
So always seen from the currently loaded component on and if that is something which is not 100 percent

04:35.070 --> 04:35.610
clear.

04:35.640 --> 04:41.460
You will see Froude its module but also feel free to play around with it add your own rotes add some

04:41.460 --> 04:45.640
nesting add more complex pauvres and see how this works out.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.150
But for now let's continue with our application.

04:48.180 --> 04:51.910
I will remove this reload page link and that's enhanced as a bit more
