With the basics about routings set of hands or application of but by going back to the app marshal and

00:08.920 --> 00:16.390
adding some other routes to it let's say that besides our users route here we also want to be able to

00:16.390 --> 00:25.150
load a single user so to load the user component which simply well it gives us that single user for

00:25.160 --> 00:30.010
that we might want to load a user dynamically because if we have a look at our users component we see

00:30.010 --> 00:32.460
we get free users with different IDs.

00:32.740 --> 00:39.550
So be nice if we could pass the idea of the user we want to load in that route path.

00:39.910 --> 00:44.340
One approach would be to set up a route with User 1 and then one with users.

00:44.350 --> 00:51.460
Q And doesn't look very optimal because it's not very dynamic and still how would we know inside of

00:51.460 --> 00:52.210
this component.

00:52.270 --> 00:53.820
Which route was loaded.

00:53.980 --> 00:58.960
Okay we could parse the path manually but that's not really a great approach.

00:58.960 --> 01:04.740
Instead we can add parameters to our routes dynamic segments in our pauvres.

01:05.020 --> 01:11.560
We do it just by adding a colon and then any name you like like for example ID you will later be able

01:11.560 --> 01:16.670
to retrieve the parameter inside of the loaded component by the name you specify here.

01:16.690 --> 01:23.780
So by ID in this case and the colon simply touts angler that this is a dynamic part of the path.

01:24.070 --> 01:32.650
Without Colan only routes which are a user slash ID end with ID I literally mean the word ID would lead

01:32.650 --> 01:36.510
to this component with a colon user slash.

01:36.550 --> 01:43.180
Anything else would load this component and anything else would be interpreted as the ID.

01:43.180 --> 01:53.050
Now with this place we are able to load a component the user component with this dynamic piece sent

01:53.050 --> 01:54.070
to it.

01:54.070 --> 01:58.930
So if we have a look to this user component where at this user one component here we simply say user

01:58.930 --> 02:05.680
with ID and now we have a dummy text you're loaded and username with some damning text here.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.600
Now for now we won't touch this.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.910
We won't use this parameter.

02:09.940 --> 02:11.560
We will do this next lecture.

02:11.670 --> 02:14.510
Let's now see if we successfully reach this.

02:14.530 --> 02:19.400
So if we save this to recompile and we go back we are end users.

02:19.510 --> 02:23.220
Let's add slash something here.

02:24.050 --> 02:27.590
And you see the single user component was loaded the same.

02:27.740 --> 02:29.980
If we add slash 1 here.

02:30.290 --> 02:37.760
So this thing the segment after slash users is indeed interpreted as dynamic.

02:37.880 --> 02:43.530
Otherwise we would get the error that users slash One is the unknown route.

02:43.610 --> 02:50.850
It isn't because we set it up to be a known one because again we added this dynamic POF segment here.

02:51.100 --> 02:59.190
It is how we can dynamically load some route how we can encode some data into our path.

02:59.210 --> 03:02.940
How can we get access to the data in the loaded component.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.020
Because that of course is another key question.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.420
Let's take a closer look in the next lecture
