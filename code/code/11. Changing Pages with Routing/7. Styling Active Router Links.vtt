00:02.610 --> 00:05.120
We of course added navigation to our page.

00:05.310 --> 00:06.960
But one issue is dead.

00:06.960 --> 00:14.290
Whilst it does work fine we get no visual indication of what the currently active route is.

00:14.400 --> 00:21.150
It would be nice if the selected TAB would change and that of course is only as C-s as thing because

00:21.150 --> 00:26.730
if you check your app component a year you'll see we get this act of class on the list item which determines

00:26.730 --> 00:28.880
whether this is marked as active.

00:28.950 --> 00:35.670
If that's if this link gets to ride C S S classes or not so it would be nice if we could dynamically

00:35.670 --> 00:37.910
set this class.

00:37.920 --> 00:44.730
I will remove it from here and how and how can we now set a dynamically angular gives us a specific

00:44.790 --> 00:46.470
directive for this.

00:46.600 --> 00:55.470
The rowdier link act of directive and to convenient thing about this directive is you can add a two

00:55.640 --> 01:03.060
wrapping element like we do here to the list item or orzo of course to the link itself.

01:03.380 --> 01:08.170
And it will attach the class you specify in between your for example active.

01:08.180 --> 01:11.350
So this should be a string to that element.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.530
It sits on now active on the link itself wouldn't do anything.

01:15.530 --> 01:20.310
When using bootstrap here for this taps look we need to add to the list item.

01:20.330 --> 01:24.700
But this of course depends on which package or which C S S code you are using.

01:24.770 --> 01:27.320
And here you could specify any class you want.

01:27.440 --> 01:31.310
Like my active class or whatever that is.

01:31.700 --> 01:37.910
So here it is active to make it look nice and bootstraps the world and I will add it to all my links

01:37.910 --> 01:38.490
here.

01:38.720 --> 01:46.700
So now theoretically all my links should receive as active C S S class once they are clicked or when

01:46.700 --> 01:48.360
they are active.

01:48.380 --> 01:55.160
So if we have a look at this it seems to work because we still have homes set as our active page even

01:55.160 --> 02:01.880
though we remove this class this act of class we had there before if I like service it gets marked as

02:01.880 --> 02:02.720
active too.

02:02.900 --> 02:09.940
And the same for users so this works but somehow home is always marked as active.

02:10.070 --> 02:12.790
So that does not seem to work correctly.

02:12.790 --> 02:14.050
What's wrong here.

02:15.540 --> 02:19.880
Well the router link active directive does one thing.

02:20.130 --> 02:27.150
It analyzes your currently loaded path and then checks which links lead to a route which uses this POV.

02:27.540 --> 02:31.960
And by default it marks element as active in Anstiss.

02:31.980 --> 02:40.710
See us as class if it contains the path you are on or if this link is part of the POV which is currently

02:40.710 --> 02:41.460
loaded.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.270
So for the slash service link or the slash user's link.

02:46.330 --> 02:52.380
This is of course the case once WikiLeaks servers or users for the slash nothing link which is the first

02:52.380 --> 02:53.690
one the home page.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.410
This is always the case.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.610
We always have Slash nothing at the beginning of our path here.

02:59.670 --> 03:06.480
So if we are on slash users Well there is this empty path in between you could say the same for service

03:06.660 --> 03:08.900
and the same for just home of course.

03:09.270 --> 03:14.040
So the empty pop segment is part of all payoffs.

03:14.040 --> 03:19.170
Still we don't want to have the home being marked as active all the time.

03:19.170 --> 03:25.560
So to fix this we can add some configuration to this router link active directive that will split this

03:25.560 --> 03:33.620
up all over multiple lines to make this a bit easier to read so we can add a special configuration to

03:33.620 --> 03:35.930
our router link act of directive.

03:35.960 --> 03:44.470
So on the same element as Powerlink active was added to we can add rowdier link active options.

03:44.930 --> 03:50.220
And this now needs some property binding because we don't just pass a string there.

03:50.360 --> 03:56.850
Instead we pass a javascript object and that would not work without having our square brackets.

03:56.870 --> 04:01.850
So with square brackets we can pass anything which will be resolved dynamically like this javascript

04:01.850 --> 04:02.820
object.

04:02.930 --> 04:12.480
And here we can basically add one important configuration say expect and set this to true so exact as

04:12.480 --> 04:18.070
a kind of a resurged property on this object you passed to Routier link active options.

04:18.190 --> 04:23.760
And this will now basically tell Engler only as this router link act of class.

04:23.770 --> 04:26.390
So this active seeis S-Class in this case.

04:26.610 --> 04:32.830
If the exact the full path is well whatever does link leads to.

04:32.830 --> 04:39.000
So only if everything is just slash and not if it is only part of the path so does emplace.

04:39.190 --> 04:45.040
Now you see it still is marked as active on the empty path at the starting page but if you go to slash

04:45.050 --> 04:51.820
servers now only servers is marked this active because now we fixed this we change the default behavior

04:52.060 --> 04:59.220
to make sure we only marked as if the full path is well whatever we have on our router link
