00:02.500 --> 00:10.360
Thus far we had a look at two roud guards at Dijk can act the word card and it's neighbored can actual

00:10.390 --> 00:18.670
child guard and a D can de-activate card later in this course in the modules section where you learn

00:18.670 --> 00:26.760
more about the angle or module we will have a look at our routing related questions and also add gardes

00:26.760 --> 00:27.140
again.

00:27.160 --> 00:31.080
But I'll come back to this in this mortal year.

00:31.090 --> 00:38.380
There are still two things I want to have a look at and the first one is how to get some data or static

00:38.380 --> 00:41.800
data or dynamic data once a route is loaded.

00:41.800 --> 00:48.130
Now you might correctly say hey we learned how to get data how to get a parameter out of d u or L and

00:48.130 --> 00:49.180
then use that.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.330
But that's not what I mean.

00:51.370 --> 00:57.700
I mean that some of your routes depend on data they receive either statically each time they are loaded

00:58.090 --> 01:00.500
or they will resolve dynamically.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.870
Maybe I show some examples to make this clearer.

01:03.070 --> 01:05.970
Let's start with static data.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.920
We get our page not found component here.

01:08.920 --> 01:15.380
Now let's say we don't want to use that pansit I will create a new component the error or page component.

01:15.610 --> 01:21.690
So this will be a generic arrow page where the page not found component is pretty much limited to well

01:21.710 --> 01:23.010
for 0 4.

01:23.110 --> 01:31.060
Not found errors we could imagine that we reuse the error page for all kinds of errors or removed expect

01:31.130 --> 01:32.270
Katia's file.

01:32.380 --> 01:35.780
And here in the template now I don't want to outbuild poet.

01:35.950 --> 01:38.120
Page not found or anything like this.

01:38.140 --> 01:42.990
Instead let's say we have some error message which I want to output.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.280
Why string interpellation.

01:45.280 --> 01:52.660
The issue of course is this property doesn't exist as of now so let's add it here let's add error message

01:52.660 --> 01:59.380
Judah's component and we know it should be a string but still what would be the message because again

01:59.410 --> 02:01.600
we might reuse this page.

02:01.810 --> 02:07.240
Now for routing there only is one proper use case you want to target right now and that is that a route

02:07.270 --> 02:08.370
is not found.

02:08.710 --> 02:17.320
So in our route set up here our redirect round here which redirects to not found which Lhotse page on

02:17.320 --> 02:23.590
found component here in the end here I will duplicate this and then commun it out so that I have to

02:23.590 --> 02:25.130
code stored here.

02:25.170 --> 02:33.370
I now want to use the brand new error page component so this error page component which was generated

02:33.370 --> 02:38.830
by Desilu I and for which you should add an import here of course you should have also added this to

02:38.830 --> 02:45.060
your main module if the Seelye didn't do this automatically for you here and import too.

02:45.190 --> 02:50.190
So with this we're now loading this not found page or excuse me this error page.

02:50.260 --> 02:53.220
If retargeting not found route.

02:53.260 --> 02:56.460
Still the issue is dead.

02:56.500 --> 03:00.660
Here we try to output a message which we haven't gotten here.

03:01.060 --> 03:08.260
Now we could reach this page through different hooks but or for different errors but for each error

03:08.410 --> 03:10.130
there is only one message.

03:10.330 --> 03:18.370
So in our app routing module we know that if we have not found route and therefore not found error we

03:18.370 --> 03:26.070
will always display the same error message and we can pass such static data with the data property here.

03:26.220 --> 03:33.330
The data property allows us to pass an object here and in this object we can define any key value pairs

03:33.400 --> 03:35.160
any properties we want.

03:35.260 --> 03:39.420
Like for example our message which is Page Not Found.

03:39.500 --> 03:44.170
Now again you might say if I define it statically here and we will soon fetch it and the error page.

03:44.170 --> 03:46.370
Why don't you find it there to begin with.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.510
Because you might be used as arrow page.

03:48.510 --> 03:54.070
Maybe you got a number out reaching does where we want to display a different error or we have a different

03:54.070 --> 03:56.980
logic in our application which might render this page.

03:56.980 --> 04:03.280
So again it might be reusable but for each use case there is a specific date of the specific message

04:03.280 --> 04:04.120
you want to pass.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.270
Like the page not found message here.

04:06.580 --> 04:14.260
So with dates we now want to retrieve that whenever we load our error page component and 4 days like

04:14.260 --> 04:15.780
parents like we perms.

04:15.850 --> 04:17.770
We need the active route.

04:17.830 --> 04:20.830
So let's inject our activated roud here.

04:20.830 --> 04:23.910
Make sure to import it and an NGO in it.

04:24.160 --> 04:32.200
I can then again ever assign it by using the snapshot of this route and then simply the data object

04:32.290 --> 04:34.220
where I can now access message.

04:34.300 --> 04:39.340
And of course I have to make sure that this property exists and we do make sure because we know we can

04:39.340 --> 04:44.920
only reach just component through this route where we will have this message properties set.

04:45.070 --> 04:49.170
So this is the way of using it with it's snapshot work.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.020
Just like with parens required perms.

04:51.040 --> 04:57.760
If this could possibly change while you still are on this page you want to use your route and here the

04:57.760 --> 05:04.720
data are serviceable to which you subscribe and which will give you this Deda object you're of type

05:04.720 --> 05:10.750
data some dummy data type you can import from Anglo router which will in the end give you access to

05:10.750 --> 05:13.950
your data or in the properties you defined there.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.350
So here you could then also set it equal to data message.

05:18.370 --> 05:21.580
Both would work depending on whether it may change or not.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.510
So yeah both should work.

05:23.530 --> 05:28.630
I will comment out the first use case here but again if it doesn't change the using the snapshot is

05:28.660 --> 05:30.470
absolutely correct or fine.

05:30.790 --> 05:36.310
So with this we should now bind this and therefore if we save this and go back to our application enter

05:36.310 --> 05:43.950
some invalid route here we correct Lizy page not found the static error message we passed with the data

05:43.960 --> 05:50.590
property and this is a typical use case when ever you have some static data you want to pass to a route.

05:50.770 --> 05:54.190
Now let's move on to some dynamic data in the next lecture.
