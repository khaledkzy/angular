Attached to this lecture you find this example project here.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.420
Now on the first look it might look nice but it has one fundamental issue.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.620
We can switch to page this year.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.000
We get some tabs at the top but these tabs are not working and therefore what we see on this home page

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.110
are actually all the components.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.550
I later want to split up over multiple pages or multiple pages in quotation marks I should say in this

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.750
module we do have the home servers and the user's page.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.440
And as you can see here we got users servers and the home page on the same page.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.220
So that is something we can improve but it would be nice to have separate pages pages as I said.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.730
So a slash user's page or a slash service page and so on.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.310
So this is what we're going to work in this module and for this we need route's we need the angle a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:02.090
router and angler a router needs to know which routes our front an application has.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.790
So you might notice a pattern from a full stack application where you also register some routes the

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.270
user can then wizard.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.800
We can do the same and Engler and we will do this in the next lecture.
