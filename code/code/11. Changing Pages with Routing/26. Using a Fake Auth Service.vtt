00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.390
Now let's finish this can actuate behavior by allowing the user to log in or quickly do this by going

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.740
to my home component.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:22.020
And there I want to add two new buttons one log in button and one log out button and I will add some

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.950
scenes as Klaus's button.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.570
Default maybe and Button button de-evolved here too.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:40.970
And here I want to execute on log out and for the other one of course I will execute on log in and I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.610
will keep just really simple since it's not about having a nice UI here I would simply inject my office

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.340
service here of type of service of course.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.260
Make sure to add the import at the top and then I'll add my two methods here.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.120
So on log in we'll simply reach out to the off service and call the log in method to set is locked in

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.630
boolean to true.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.660
And on log out will of course do the same but will call the log out method to set it to false.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.320
And this simple improvement now makes sure that we can of course log in.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.420
We don't see any visual indication here but we do see it if we try to access a single server.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.720
Now this is working always after DS 800 milliseconds which it takes to evaluate whether we are allowed

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.740
to access.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.330
But if I switch just back to log out again you see we're redirected again.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.810
So now we can control this.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.590
Now we finished is fake off service and more importantly we can actually wait.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.090
It's
