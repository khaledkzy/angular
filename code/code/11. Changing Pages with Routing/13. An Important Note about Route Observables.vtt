In the last lecture we learned how we can subscribe to your parents to update them or to react to any

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.050
changes to them.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.190
Update our page.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.580
If you already are on that page and we set up this subscription using observables and this works fine

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.860
and you don't have to change anything here.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.310
I want to bring something to your attention though the fact that you don't have to add anything else

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.720
to this component here simply because angler does something for you in the background which is super

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.950
important.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.120
It cleans up the subscription you set up here whenever a disk component is destroyed because if it wouldn't

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.340
do it as what are you doing here you're subscribing to parameter changes and let's say you then leave

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.720
this component and later you come back.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.460
Well once you left this component will be destroyed.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.010
And when you come back a new one will be created but this subscription here will always live on in memory

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.690
because it's not closely tied to your component.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.580
So if the component is destroyed the subscription won't now it will be here because angler handles this

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.140
destroying of the subscription for you.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.750
But theoretically you might want to implement or destroy lifecycle hook importing it from an angler

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.740
coord.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.510
Therefore you have to implement Engy on the stroy and then you could store this subscription year in

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.350
some property.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.850
Let's name it.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:37.920
Parents subscription which will be of type subscription and subscription needs to be imported from our

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.580
exchange as subscription.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.570
Our exchange says Chayefsky package offering all these observables functionality as I mentioned it's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.460
not shipping with angular but angler is using this package.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.000
So this type of subscription is parents subscription property is now bound to this subscription we're

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.170
setting up year when calling subscribe to returns us as subscription.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.490
And once the component gets destroyed we could now access to subscription and unsubscribe.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.410
And again because it's important you don't have to do this you can leave it as it was before because

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.170
Engler will do this for you regarding these Raut observables.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.260
But if you add your own observables and it will come back to this in the observable section following

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.560
this section you have to unsubscribe on your own.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.600
And I just wanted to bring it to your attention because it's always super important to understand what's

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.950
happening behind the scenes.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.530
Again it's not necessary here but it doesn't hurt to also do it manually to here.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.310
It won't add anything back to your app but doing it like this.
