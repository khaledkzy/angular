00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.060
Throughout the section you'll learn a lot about routing you know how to set up routes to load them both

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.630
through route link or programmatically how to pass parents query parents how to use that data how to

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.660
load different components and much more.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.220
One important feature is left in this module which I definitely want to cover.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.110
Roud guards.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:35.190
So basically functionality logic code which is executed before a route is loaded or once you want to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.470
leave a route.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.980
Let's start with the simple use case.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.210
Let's say you only want to give access to your server component your single server component or the

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.640
edit server component.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.880
If a user is locked in now we're not going to add a full log in functionality for this.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.150
We will later have the authentication section in this course but who will fake it for now.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.660
Still we want to check this before any of our supperless year.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.970
So service free service one.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:16.110
And then also the added routes are accessed now manually checking this in the ON IN IT function on our

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.800
server and edits server component would be very cumbersome because you wouldn't have to add it in both

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.250
components and if you add more components belonging to the service feature you would have to add this

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.200
over and over again.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.500
So therefore we want to use a feature built into the angler router running some code before the component

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.550
is loaded.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.200
We will use the can activate guard and we will do so in the next lecture
