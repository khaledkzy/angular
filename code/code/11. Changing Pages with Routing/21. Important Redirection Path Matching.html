<p>In our example, we didn't encounter any issues when we tried to redirect the user. But that's not always the case when adding redirections.</p>

<p>By default, Angular matches paths by prefix. That means, that the following route will match both <code>/recipes</code>  and just <code>/</code> </p>













<p><code>{ path: '', redirectTo: '/somewhere-else' }</code> </p>













<p>Actually, Angular will give you an error here, because that's a common gotcha: This route will now <strong>ALWAYS</strong> redirect you! Why?</p>







<p>Since the default matching strategy is <code>"prefix"</code> , Angular checks if the path you entered in the URL does <strong>start with the path</strong> specified in the route. Of course every path starts with <code>''</code>  (Important: That's no whitespace, it's simply "nothing").</p>



<p>To fix this behavior, you need to change the matching strategy to<code> "full"</code> :</p>



<p><code>{ path: '', redirectTo: '/somewhere-else', pathMatch: 'full' }</code> <br></p>

<p>Now, you only get redirected, if the full path is <code>''</code>  (so only if you got NO other content in your path in this example).</p>
