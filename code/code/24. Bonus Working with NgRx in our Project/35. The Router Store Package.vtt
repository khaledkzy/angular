The first our package I want to show you is actually related to the router state.

00:08.180 --> 00:14.690
Thus far we didn't really care about routing but you could argue that routing or changes in the route

00:15.130 --> 00:18.130
awls are changes in the state of our application.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.000
We switched a page.

00:20.060 --> 00:26.830
And if that leads to us loading a special recipe we could argue that this is indeed a state change the

00:26.860 --> 00:33.740
two below that recipe changed so therefore it would be convenient if it could simply get informed about

00:33.830 --> 00:35.070
every state change.

00:35.090 --> 00:43.670
If dead would emit an event and it turns out that we got a package we can use to listen to router restage

00:43.670 --> 00:44.740
changes.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.890
So let's quit DNG serve process and install that package.

00:47.890 --> 00:50.590
Why install that as save.

00:50.780 --> 00:55.990
And then the package name is at N-G or X slash router store.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.740
Now this is a super simple package.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.960
It's super simple to set up.

01:01.280 --> 01:10.090
All we have to do is we have to go to our app Marchal once it is installed and now there we can add

01:10.090 --> 01:12.260
it to our imports.

01:12.260 --> 01:21.340
It's called store router connecting module and it needs to be imported from at or X router store.

01:21.470 --> 01:29.300
So make sure to add this import to your app module and add this entry your to your imports.

01:29.330 --> 01:32.760
Now here you don't need to call for root.

01:32.780 --> 01:35.790
It should work just like that.

01:35.830 --> 01:42.360
However to really see that it works I will show you another useful package.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.560
Let's have a look at it in the next lecture.
