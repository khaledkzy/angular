Here's one additional facts I noticed we have to do in the off guard service.

00:08.490 --> 00:18.510
We also select the slice of our state of state and then we map is to return if we are offended or not.

00:18.510 --> 00:22.620
Now this will not work optimally here.

00:22.620 --> 00:25.960
We have to do something we had to do for the HTP interceptor.

00:25.960 --> 00:36.090
Q We have to add take one year to make sure we only take one request or one well element from the slice

00:36.160 --> 00:37.890
per guard activation

00:40.580 --> 00:46.410
otherwise this will run infinitely and might lead to unexpected behaviors.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.330
With this in place though it should work fine.

00:49.340 --> 00:54.580
And let's actually see if this works fine for click new recipe like this doesn't work.

00:54.590 --> 01:06.110
No if I do log in here and I click on new recipe copy that your L log out and re enter it I am blocked.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.580
So this does now not work.

01:08.740 --> 01:12.400
And I also recognize that up on logging out were redirected.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.910
So debt is something else I want to implement in the next lecture.

01:15.910 --> 01:18.180
Feel free to try it on your own.
