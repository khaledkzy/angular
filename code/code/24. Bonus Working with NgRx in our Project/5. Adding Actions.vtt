00:02.010 --> 00:09.050
In the last lecture we started working on that producer but we get stuck when we wanted to retrieve

00:09.050 --> 00:09.590
the data.

00:09.590 --> 00:16.550
We probably passed with the action once we dispatch it for days on end and you fall into my shopping

00:16.550 --> 00:21.680
list folder no name and shopping list Daut actions Dot.

00:21.720 --> 00:22.530
Yes.

00:22.610 --> 00:26.260
Though you could of course also add to the reducers file.

00:26.270 --> 00:31.940
I'd simply like adding a new fall here to keep it clearly separated even though that adds quite a lot

00:31.940 --> 00:38.370
of falls to that whole setup to make this a bit easier and is purely optional.

00:38.450 --> 00:42.690
I'll add a new subdirectory to shopping list which all names store.

00:42.740 --> 00:43.770
You could all name it.

00:43.930 --> 00:49.490
And you are x to indicated here you only got files related to state management.

00:49.490 --> 00:54.880
So move my actions fall and my reducers fall into their.

00:54.990 --> 00:57.610
That of course means that users fall.

00:57.740 --> 01:02.800
The import of the ingredient model has to be adjusted by moving up one for relevel.

01:03.260 --> 01:06.150
So back to the actions I created a new file.

01:06.230 --> 01:15.620
And here I first of all want to import D.S. object from Ed and our X store as we did before in the reducers

01:15.620 --> 01:16.960
file.

01:16.970 --> 01:21.570
Now I again want to export a constant till ready tears.

01:21.590 --> 01:26.240
Let me move it from the reducers file into the actions file.

01:26.330 --> 01:28.970
This constant add ingredient.

01:29.370 --> 01:31.690
Now I won't stop here though.

01:31.790 --> 01:37.940
Now export a class to an unnamed class and ingredient.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.120
Not all characters are uppercase here.

01:40.130 --> 01:41.450
That's an Avro convention.

01:41.450 --> 01:48.020
Name your classes like this starting with an uppercase character and at the beginning each new word

01:48.020 --> 01:52.840
in the overall name with the uppercase character but keep the average character as normal.

01:53.090 --> 01:58.870
Here I will implement action as an interface because this is what it is in the end.

01:59.420 --> 02:07.490
So now I have this dishcloths and since I import excuse me implement action I am forced to provide a

02:07.490 --> 02:16.520
read only type property which in this case here will be an ingredient list constant So this string here

02:16.640 --> 02:23.530
in the end this one and any two definer or provide a read only type because that's the one thing ection

02:23.540 --> 02:24.340
gave me.

02:24.340 --> 02:27.890
Remember we hit this problem in the last lecture.

02:27.890 --> 02:33.860
Now I know that an intermediate is actually an action which shouldn't Chesed have a type to be able

02:33.860 --> 02:35.560
to find out that it is.

02:35.560 --> 02:42.140
This type of action but also given me a payload so some additional data I can pass with it and I have

02:42.140 --> 02:48.740
to add this manually because not every action might require a payload and ngi or X doesn't want to force

02:48.740 --> 02:50.320
me to have one.

02:50.390 --> 02:57.860
If you do need one like we do here you can simply add it by adding a number property cutis class which

02:57.920 --> 03:00.320
all name payload.

03:00.320 --> 03:04.960
And in this case it should be of type Ingredion because that is what I want to add.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.760
Make sure to import your model here.

03:07.970 --> 03:14.420
So now I have to payload property here Q And I'm exporting this class.

03:14.420 --> 03:21.710
Now finally I want to bundle all actions as set up in this file and right now it's only one Buddle become

03:21.710 --> 03:30.950
more in one single export type I export and type is just typescript feature we can use we can find our

03:30.980 --> 03:32.080
own type.

03:32.150 --> 03:39.390
In this case it shall be a shopping list actions type that seems like a fitting name.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.550
Which in this case is only add and dreariest.

03:42.710 --> 03:47.610
So I'm using the type of this class and I'm exporting it here on a shopping list actions.

03:47.610 --> 03:51.400
Again this is useful once we start adding more actions.

03:51.470 --> 03:54.370
Now with that back to the reducer let's work on that.
