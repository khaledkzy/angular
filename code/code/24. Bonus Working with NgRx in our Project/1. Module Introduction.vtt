00:02.550 --> 00:09.540
Welcome to this bonus module in this course you'll learn a lot about Engler and also about state management

00:09.540 --> 00:10.320
and Engler.

00:10.380 --> 00:19.550
Now what is state state simply describes the wild state of your application is the user authenticated.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.270
Are the recipes loaded.

00:21.310 --> 00:22.650
That is the state.

00:22.660 --> 00:29.080
This the information you need in your front and in your angular application for it to work correctly.

00:29.090 --> 00:34.650
Now thus far in this course we managed state through services we stored the authentication status the

00:34.670 --> 00:41.400
servers we store the recipes in the service and we use services and methods in these services to interact

00:41.400 --> 00:45.360
with our state to load more recipes or add a new one.

00:45.360 --> 00:51.990
Nothing wrong with that especially with the set up we use here where we also use our exchange as subjects

00:52.080 --> 00:53.510
as event emitters.

00:53.610 --> 00:57.890
Check out the previous coord sections to learn how we implement them.

00:57.950 --> 01:01.910
So especially this set up is really good and you can absolutely use it.

01:02.100 --> 01:08.700
However if you are diving into much bigger applications or you just feel like you want a little bit

01:08.700 --> 01:14.890
of a more elaborate approach possibly also using immutable data structures.

01:15.060 --> 01:22.590
Then this module might be interesting for you in this module will dive into N-G are X which is an additional

01:22.590 --> 01:25.470
Pekovic you can use in your angular project.

01:25.470 --> 01:32.720
It's not part of angular itself that's important but you can install it and it's all about state management

01:32.890 --> 01:35.800
and forcing a redux like pattern.

01:35.940 --> 01:39.090
If you're from reac you might know what redux is.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.230
If not I will explain it in this section.

01:42.540 --> 01:47.170
So that is what we'll dive into in this section into ngi or X how you may use it.

01:47.250 --> 01:50.250
And I thought why would I show you some slides.

01:50.250 --> 01:53.860
Or in theory if we already have a course project.

01:53.880 --> 02:00.780
So let's take the course project office coords and completely change the way we manage our state and

02:00.780 --> 02:03.450
use energy or X instead of services.

02:03.450 --> 02:04.750
So let's dive into that.
