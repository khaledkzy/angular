00:02.160 --> 00:07.000
So we completed this module and maybe you did this with angular five.

00:07.020 --> 00:09.500
But maybe you also did with angular six.

00:09.660 --> 00:16.860
And if you're using angler's 6 You probably used our ex-chief s comp at that at least is what I recommended

00:16.860 --> 00:23.430
that the beginning of this module because angular six depends on our X chase version 6 and does in turn

00:23.430 --> 00:30.360
change just the way you have to import some things and use our X Cheras operators are x yes combat ensures

00:30.660 --> 00:36.500
that you can use to send X as you saw it in this course but it would be boring to end like this.

00:36.630 --> 00:38.910
Let's get rid of our actually combat.

00:38.910 --> 00:43.980
And let me show you how you can fully update to our Yes without that package.

00:43.980 --> 00:52.070
So for that besides removing it from the package the Jason fall older around NPM uninstall.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.740
Dash dash save our.

00:53.790 --> 00:56.400
Yes compact in this project folder.

00:56.400 --> 01:01.790
So in the terminal in this project folder to get rid of debt dependency.

01:02.010 --> 01:09.660
Once we got rid of that all restart and surf and now you will see that it fails that we get an error

01:09.840 --> 01:15.540
because obviously the our exchange syntax and the way we use operators is incorrect now.

01:15.810 --> 01:19.420
And in this video we'll now update this and fix this.

01:19.440 --> 01:26.330
So for this let's dive into our angular app and let's simply go through it step by step file by a file.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.310
Now in the app routing File we're not using any R X code.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.120
So there is nothing we need to change.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.940
They're the same in the app module in the app component if we have a look.

01:36.960 --> 01:43.710
We also don't need to do anything that is it for the root falls in the store folder in the root store

01:43.850 --> 01:44.620
folder.

01:44.760 --> 01:50.880
We got that app reducer but there we don't actually have to do anything because here we are using energy

01:50.880 --> 01:52.790
are X but not are x.

01:52.810 --> 01:59.520
Yes and ngi are X behind the scenes already updated to use the latest words incorrectly in the shopping

01:59.520 --> 02:03.360
list module there's nothing to do in a shopping list component.

02:03.370 --> 02:08.940
However we've got an import importing observable from our X-Trace observable.

02:08.940 --> 02:13.350
Now let's simply turn this to import absorbable from our X-Trace.

02:13.410 --> 02:17.150
This is how we import observables using our access version 6.

02:17.190 --> 02:21.700
Now my ID actually marks this as an error but it isn't.

02:21.720 --> 02:26.320
So let's move on to the store folder in the shopping list folder.

02:26.550 --> 02:28.290
There we got the reducers folder.

02:28.290 --> 02:31.040
We're not using any Our ex-chief logic there.

02:31.170 --> 02:34.160
Neither do we in the actions live file.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.910
Any shopping edit component here.

02:38.140 --> 02:42.540
We actually do import something from our X-Trace days subscription.

02:42.610 --> 02:50.110
So let's all can word this word to use just our access and not our access slash subscription.

02:50.110 --> 02:56.380
With that let's move on the shared folder there we get the shared module where we don't use any R X

02:56.410 --> 02:57.420
test code.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.450
We got our logging interceptor.

02:59.530 --> 03:02.130
And here we do indeed use our Yes.

03:02.140 --> 03:09.840
Again we do have our import from our access slash observable and we're using to do operator.

03:10.330 --> 03:16.620
Now we need to change that import because we're importing operators from our access operators now.

03:17.050 --> 03:24.640
And for to do or Braider it all change from due to tap because do is there is a reserve the word in

03:24.640 --> 03:25.520
Javascript.

03:25.690 --> 03:29.590
And since we use that you use it as a function approach.

03:29.590 --> 03:31.520
We can use keywords.

03:31.750 --> 03:38.950
So we got to tap we Knoll's need to change the way we use it instead of changing do like this we call

03:39.220 --> 03:42.860
pipe on our observable and we wrap do.

03:43.030 --> 03:48.890
And this again explains why we can't use it like do but why we have to name it tappet by it.

03:48.890 --> 03:54.320
It was renamed to tap because do would be a reserved keyword.

03:54.370 --> 03:57.610
So this is the logging interceptor updated in the model.

03:57.610 --> 04:01.060
We don't have any Our X-Trace code in the dropdown directive.

04:01.060 --> 04:04.990
We also don't have any such code in the off intercept or we do though.

04:05.350 --> 04:10.930
There again let's change dead imports to import the observable from our ex-chief Yes instead of our

04:10.930 --> 04:12.620
exchange as observable.

04:12.850 --> 04:15.080
And we're importing the switch map here.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.510
And we're also using the take operator.

04:17.620 --> 04:21.370
Now previously this was unlocked by some Obert import.

04:21.370 --> 04:29.680
Now we have to import it separately so let's import from our exchange as operators.

04:29.680 --> 04:38.560
And what we import is take the take operator and switch map with these two operators added.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.500
We now should use them and we use them again with the pipe method.

04:42.630 --> 04:45.790
Take us the first argument we passed to pipe.

04:45.910 --> 04:51.340
Then we add a comma because the second argument will be our switched map operator and then we simply

04:51.340 --> 04:57.940
close the parentheses with that we also refactored doesn't recentre we're using pipe.

04:57.940 --> 05:05.110
And it wraps both the take and the switch map operator which we import from our exchanges operators.

05:05.110 --> 05:09.250
Let's move on to the recipe's section and the recipe's routing File.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.510
We're not using any R x yes code.

05:11.650 --> 05:16.150
Never do we in the recipe's module in the recipe's component.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.000
We also got no relevant code.

05:18.130 --> 05:23.900
And then the recipe model we also don't use any observables in a store folder here.

05:23.920 --> 05:30.310
We've got the reducer now now there we also don't use any Our access code and we get the effects folder

05:30.490 --> 05:34.300
now in the effects folder we got a lot of our extra Yes relevant code.

05:34.480 --> 05:43.090
We got these two operators switch map and with latest front so ask before will import them from our

05:43.150 --> 05:47.480
access operators and we do this by simply.

05:47.510 --> 05:56.140
Well unsurprisingly import things which map and with latest from these two functions we now get rid

05:56.140 --> 05:57.690
of these imports here.

05:57.940 --> 06:02.560
And now if we scroll down reusing it here you were using the switch map.

06:02.620 --> 06:10.250
So let's instead use pipe and let's wrap the switch map with our pipe assignment here.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.360
However we're also using map here.

06:12.400 --> 06:17.140
So we should also import that previously it was unlocked by some other import.

06:17.140 --> 06:22.330
Now let's import a map here too and let's grab that map code.

06:22.330 --> 06:32.160
So this whole map operator here and that's actually added as a second argument ofter switch map like

06:32.160 --> 06:32.660
this.

06:33.970 --> 06:34.930
If we scroll down.

06:34.930 --> 06:41.860
We also see that on the second of fact we should use pipe we should use to use it to group or to pipe

06:41.950 --> 06:45.790
with latest from and offer again switch map.

06:45.790 --> 06:47.330
So let's get rid of the dog here.

06:47.470 --> 06:48.810
That's the set at a comma.

06:48.850 --> 06:50.900
Let's add that second operator.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.410
And here we go.

06:52.450 --> 06:56.210
So now which map is also added to the pipe statement here.

06:57.490 --> 07:02.920
With that we update at the recipe's effects file in the recipe's actions fall.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.360
We don't have to do anything.

07:04.900 --> 07:10.960
And the recipes start component that's looking good recipe a list component here we're importing the

07:10.960 --> 07:11.560
observable.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.500
We should do that from just our ex-chief Yes.

07:14.740 --> 07:16.930
And the recipe item component.

07:17.010 --> 07:22.830
Everything's looking good in the recipe edit component here if we scan through it.

07:22.840 --> 07:23.910
This is looking good too.

07:23.950 --> 07:26.200
We're not using any observables here.

07:26.290 --> 07:28.260
We're using subscribe but this is fine.

07:28.260 --> 07:32.050
This is not using observable operators or anything like that.

07:32.110 --> 07:34.160
But here here we're using take.

07:34.270 --> 07:37.870
So we do actually use some observable feature in your.

07:38.110 --> 07:45.240
So let's import take from our access operators and let's replace it.

07:45.370 --> 07:53.260
So in the place where we used to take down there let's instead use pipe take because pipe is a new way

07:53.380 --> 07:58.200
to set up operators in the recipe detail component.

07:58.300 --> 07:59.850
Here we get a bunch of imports.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.090
So observable should be imported from our exchanges.

08:03.640 --> 08:13.720
And does the operator take operator should also be imported from our access operators like this with

08:13.720 --> 08:14.840
this import added.

08:14.850 --> 08:18.370
Let's scroll down and here where we are using take.

08:18.550 --> 08:21.290
Let's again rapid with pipe.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.570
This should be all the.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.110
Now we can move on to the core module.

08:26.110 --> 08:29.260
No our exchange Magic their home component.

08:29.270 --> 08:33.950
You know our access magic here and the same for the head are a component.

08:33.970 --> 08:37.260
Well almost there we get that observable import.

08:37.330 --> 08:44.020
And as you learned we import this from just observable now last but not least the off section in the

08:44.020 --> 08:50.140
off routing module there is nothing to be adjusted in the off guard here if we take a look we're using

08:50.140 --> 08:51.460
take and map.

08:51.460 --> 08:57.610
Now again we didn't import that before because we basically unlocked them with some global import in

08:57.620 --> 09:04.960
the number place of the app but now we need to explicitly import DS to our operators from our access

09:05.080 --> 09:13.150
operators and with them or did we again use pipe which takes take as the first argument and map as the

09:13.150 --> 09:14.220
second argument.

09:14.230 --> 09:17.260
And of course we need to close that pipe method.

09:17.590 --> 09:23.350
So now we're using operators correctly and you off guard in the off module there's nothing we need to

09:23.350 --> 09:25.120
adjust in the store.

09:25.140 --> 09:31.580
Yoffe reducers are looking good in the off effects file however we're using a lot of absorbable magic.

09:31.870 --> 09:39.750
So we got a bunch of operators we're using Let's therefore import them all from our access operators

09:40.240 --> 09:46.220
and they're what we need to import is Map do.

09:46.280 --> 09:51.540
But this was renamed to tap switch map and merge map.

09:51.620 --> 09:57.620
Now with these imports it we can't get rid of the old operator imports and we'll also have to import

09:57.650 --> 10:00.590
that observable creation method a bit differently.

10:00.620 --> 10:06.650
We cannot use from which will automatically infer whether it's a promise or for example an array or

10:06.650 --> 10:16.310
something like that and we import from just from our X J.S. now with that edit we have to adjust our

10:16.310 --> 10:24.070
code below of course they're all first of all and my pipe method to include all the operator said one

10:24.080 --> 10:26.770
to apply to is observable.

10:26.780 --> 10:33.790
So to does actions observable here and the first operate drill one of use is mapped so we'll leave that.

10:33.950 --> 10:36.800
But then switch maps simply separated by a comma.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.950
So it's the second argument and the pipe method.

10:38.960 --> 10:42.840
Now the same is the case for the next which map operator.

10:42.860 --> 10:48.820
It's the first argument and merge map becomes the fourth argument separated by a comma.

10:49.040 --> 10:54.460
And of course we have to add a closing parentheses at the end which closes the pipe method call.

10:54.620 --> 10:57.500
Now from Bronner's simply becomes from.

10:57.500 --> 11:03.240
And as I said this will automatically infer that we're working with promise here so that this code was

11:03.240 --> 11:03.890
adjusted.

11:03.890 --> 11:05.920
Let's go on to the next effect.

11:05.960 --> 11:12.390
There we also have to use to the operator by using the pipe method and we'll simply keep on adding arguments.

11:12.410 --> 11:15.270
So which Mabus a second operator argument.

11:15.270 --> 11:18.080
So which map again is the first one and then merge.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.970
MAP is the fourth operator we add to this pipe.

11:21.230 --> 11:24.200
And then of course we close that with an additional parentheses.

11:24.200 --> 11:28.600
And from power on this becomes for on like that.

11:28.610 --> 11:30.590
So now the two effects were adjusted.

11:30.620 --> 11:34.440
Now at the bottom we got a third effect here we're using do.

11:34.490 --> 11:36.400
So we use pipe 2.

11:36.710 --> 11:41.780
And here are just using pipe isn't enough do was renamed to tap.

11:41.790 --> 11:44.050
So let's use tap here.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.710
We're already importing tap up here.

11:46.760 --> 11:52.050
Just important to keep in mind you was renamed sauted it doesn't clash with the default.

11:52.100 --> 11:58.820
Do keyword and Javascript and that's it for this file with that we adjusted all the effects in here

11:59.090 --> 12:01.290
and we should be good to continue.

12:01.700 --> 12:07.840
And with that if we save this should now work.

12:07.990 --> 12:12.850
Now we can tell what effect that had compiled successfully that we don't seem to have any other observable

12:13.120 --> 12:19.150
stuff or code in sign in or sign up component and therefore we can now indeed successfully reload our

12:19.150 --> 12:25.630
page and well never get around to sign up won't work because I delete my firebase project but I'm not

12:25.630 --> 12:28.680
getting an error regarding any observables that that's fine.

12:28.930 --> 12:35.800
So this is now all working and so should your project now work correctly now with the latest version

12:35.800 --> 12:37.040
of our exchange.

12:37.150 --> 12:39.820
Without our exchange yes compact package.
