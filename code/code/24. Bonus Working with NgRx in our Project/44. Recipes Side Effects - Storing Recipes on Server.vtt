00:02.230 --> 00:04.210
We managed to fetch recipes.

00:04.240 --> 00:06.910
But of course we also want to store them.

00:07.060 --> 00:12.630
So for that let's head back to the side effects to the recipe effect file.

00:13.030 --> 00:18.500
And here let's now create a new side effect for storing recipes.

00:18.550 --> 00:27.880
So add at effect and I'll name it recipes store because here we had recipe fetch I want to check my

00:27.880 --> 00:34.080
actions to see if the tie is of type recipe actions.

00:35.970 --> 00:46.410
Store recipes if that is the case then I want to do something I normally call switch map here to then

00:46.530 --> 00:48.510
use the action.

00:48.630 --> 00:56.940
And in this case I store my recipes however for storing the recipes I need to get my array of recipes

00:57.180 --> 01:00.890
and data is stored in my state here.

01:01.880 --> 01:08.690
So I need access to my state inside the side effect and there's a super neat way of getting this access

01:09.350 --> 01:13.750
or add a new operator which is called with latest from.

01:13.760 --> 01:19.560
So unlock it by adding this import and now will change this.

01:19.550 --> 01:29.740
Operator offer of type with latest from this now allows me to combine the value I get here from of type

01:29.800 --> 01:34.250
which is the action with another observables value.

01:34.330 --> 01:37.000
So the value number absorbable spits out.

01:37.540 --> 01:43.830
And in this case I want to get the value from my store so I will inject the store here of type store.

01:43.900 --> 01:56.090
Make sure to add the import from it NDR X store and make sure to import as from recipe your state.

01:56.090 --> 02:01.810
So from store recipe reducers so that we can set the State of the store here.

02:01.820 --> 02:08.130
It's from recipe and they are to feature state now here with latest from Takes an observable.

02:08.130 --> 02:15.720
So it's this store select recipes because it's this slice which keep in mind returns and absorbable.

02:15.730 --> 02:22.350
I want to combine with the action sauted in switch map I actually get an array which as a first element

02:22.380 --> 02:27.230
will have an action because that's the value of this operator.

02:27.630 --> 02:34.630
And then we combine it with the value of dis absorbable which will be my state.

02:34.660 --> 02:38.280
So this is what I get and what I can work with.

02:38.310 --> 02:46.290
And now all I can do is here I can go back to my data storage service and copy the set up here where

02:46.290 --> 02:48.660
we want to store data.

02:49.170 --> 02:52.100
So back in recipe facts I'll put this in here.

02:52.530 --> 02:55.210
I need to import HTP request here.

02:55.380 --> 03:02.660
That's just a number object from the angular common HTP package.

03:02.670 --> 03:13.550
So make sure to add this to the import HTP request and add it now here I configure my request do you

03:13.550 --> 03:14.870
are Elazar right.

03:14.870 --> 03:18.380
However here I don't get my recipes like this.

03:18.380 --> 03:23.060
Instead I ex-state and their recipes.

03:23.060 --> 03:25.280
That is why I add at the state like this.

03:25.280 --> 03:31.050
Now I get my recipes are conveniently like this and I return the send request.

03:31.310 --> 03:36.260
Now in the end here I don't want to do anything else after this.

03:36.350 --> 03:40.070
So I will set this patch to false here.

03:40.430 --> 03:43.940
And with that let's see if this works as expected.

03:44.150 --> 03:53.870
For that I need to go to the hetero component and in on save data I will simply say this store dispatch

03:54.140 --> 04:01.450
new recipe actions and then store recipes.

04:01.770 --> 04:05.420
And I don't need to pass a payload here so let's save this.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.170
Let's see if it works.

04:07.260 --> 04:17.480
If I do log in and now click or go to recipe's maybe and then I'll save data that looks OK looks alright

04:17.560 --> 04:19.060
to me.

04:19.060 --> 04:23.070
Let's now see if it really did work.

04:23.080 --> 04:29.640
If I delete a recipe here the quick fetch get them back.

04:29.860 --> 04:33.020
And if I delete this recipe too.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.200
And now click save.

04:35.410 --> 04:43.400
And now I will load the lock bag in and if I now fetch it it should only give me one.

04:43.810 --> 04:46.940
So let's fetch data and this works.

04:47.350 --> 04:50.050
So saving and fetching works all fruit.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.510
Enjoy your X now.

04:51.580 --> 04:53.740
This has a huge application.

04:53.800 --> 04:57.130
We can clean up our project Let's do this next.
