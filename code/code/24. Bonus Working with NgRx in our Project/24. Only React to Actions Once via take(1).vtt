So were you successful in finding out what's causing this unnecessary HTP request being said.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.770
Once you click log out.

00:11.900 --> 00:14.730
It can be really hard to spot this issue.

00:15.020 --> 00:18.610
The thing is actually we would have gotten this on any other state.

00:18.620 --> 00:24.650
Change we make so whenever we change something about the state of our application because what's causing

00:24.650 --> 00:28.700
this is our code in the off interest setter there.

00:28.700 --> 00:32.380
I select a slice of the off state.

00:32.570 --> 00:39.220
We then switch to map which map it to extract the token and return the request.

00:39.230 --> 00:47.930
The issue is stores select sets up an ongoing subscription to our store and whenever we change to state

00:48.470 --> 00:53.690
it will fire and it will then extract the token and send the request.

00:53.690 --> 00:58.060
This is obviously not what we want and it's easy to fix.

00:58.100 --> 01:04.550
All we have to do is we have to add one additional operator here right after selecting and that's take

01:04.570 --> 01:08.300
one which means only get this value once.

01:08.300 --> 01:12.470
Now let's try it as it saved us reload our application.

01:12.680 --> 01:20.980
And first of all let's log in and let's see if we can fetch data before we can.

01:20.980 --> 01:27.340
Now let's click log out and now you see it works because now it basically unsubscribed or complete it

01:27.450 --> 01:30.440
is observable after getting one value.

01:30.640 --> 01:37.090
So this is an additional important tweak we have to make sure to make sure that our application works

01:37.090 --> 01:38.030
as it should.

01:38.290 --> 01:40.880
But with that it is indeed working as it should.

01:40.960 --> 01:47.680
And we are taking advantage of N-G our ex to manage our a vindication status as you can clearly see

01:47.980 --> 01:49.470
we can conveniently log it.

01:49.470 --> 01:55.010
Everything is updated here can log out we can register a new user here.

01:55.330 --> 02:01.200
This works we are locked in once we do it so we can fetch the data at all time.

02:01.210 --> 02:05.150
We can delete our recipes therefore and refreshed them.

02:05.170 --> 02:10.600
Does this now all working with authentication managed by a ngi are x.

02:10.610 --> 02:15.520
There's one important thing we can improve though and that is our off service.

02:15.520 --> 02:22.140
Right now we still use the service to send our HD requests and dispatch actions once they are done.

02:22.150 --> 02:23.830
Now that's not necessarily wrong.

02:23.830 --> 02:30.610
And you can absolutely leave it like this but Engy our X gives us an additional package we can use for

02:30.610 --> 02:33.970
handling these so-called side effects.

02:33.970 --> 02:40.240
So basically effect's we have while we do work with our store and with the patching actions I'll dive

02:40.240 --> 02:45.370
deeper into this and into this special package and how we can use it in the next lectures.
