I hope you enjoyed this module in this module you'll learn how you can use energy or X and the many

00:08.180 --> 00:12.040
features it offers to manage your application state.

00:12.080 --> 00:18.110
You saw that setting everything up takes quite some work but once you got it set up it's really easy

00:18.110 --> 00:24.110
to work with that and it's really powerful and you don't have to worry about your state getting out

00:24.110 --> 00:24.840
of sync.

00:24.860 --> 00:30.290
If you're working on it from two different components you don't have to think about a lot of things

00:30.290 --> 00:37.910
you have to think about when using services still using services especially with our extra subjects

00:38.080 --> 00:40.530
is a great approach for managing state.

00:40.580 --> 00:42.280
And there's nothing wrong with that.

00:42.470 --> 00:48.990
But as your application grows you might feel the need to improve your state management and that is where

00:49.120 --> 00:51.200
your ex can really help you.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.600
So I hope you took a lot with you from this section.

00:54.680 --> 00:59.750
And of course you'll find more resources attached in the final lecture of the section where I will guide

00:59.750 --> 01:05.620
you to the official NGO documentation and so on so that you can dive deeper if you want to.
