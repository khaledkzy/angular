WEBVTT

00:02.190 --> 00:04.880
So we're able to do and delete recipes.

00:04.890 --> 00:10.500
Let's not make sure we can edit and update them so any recipe adds component get a couple of interesting

00:10.500 --> 00:11.400
things going on.

00:11.400 --> 00:17.010
We're initialising our react to foreign and there's a lot of local You ice state going on here which

00:17.010 --> 00:18.420
I don't want to change.

00:18.510 --> 00:22.410
So I don't want to manage all the forum for energy or x.

00:22.440 --> 00:28.800
Only one managed the creation updating for NCR X therefore it really shouldn't be too hard.

00:30.080 --> 00:35.050
We're retrieving the relevant information about whether we're editing this or not at a point of time

00:35.060 --> 00:39.800
we're navigating to this page or wants deeper apparence change.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.510
And I don't see any need to manage this Frue NTR X here.

00:44.510 --> 00:51.360
Instead it's here and ends up mate which is interesting to us where we update or added a recipe.

00:51.530 --> 00:53.450
Let's start with updating.

00:53.570 --> 01:02.580
And for this first of all need to add the import I need to import everything as from recipe from the

01:02.580 --> 01:09.900
recipe store from the recipe actions here because I want to dispatch an action therefore the name of

01:09.900 --> 01:15.590
course should be a recipe actions to stay in line with yabber components and changes we made.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.020
So importing all the actions here.

01:18.240 --> 01:27.240
I will also need to import the state though as from recipe from the same folder but there from the recipe

01:27.240 --> 01:37.030
reduce or fall and I now want to inject the story so we'll inject store of type storm.

01:37.110 --> 01:43.620
And you know where to import this from from ngi our XT or of course.

01:43.730 --> 01:50.810
And with that in order let's set type of state we get back here it's from recipe feature state which

01:50.960 --> 01:58.020
again just remind you extends our application states that has access to all the properties of our state.

01:58.280 --> 02:01.010
And now we want to dispatch a new action here.

02:01.250 --> 02:07.460
We want to leave the old one here for reference for now we want to dispatch an action using to store

02:08.060 --> 02:18.200
the new recipe actions update recipe action where I need to pass a javascript object with an index and

02:18.200 --> 02:19.750
the updated recipe.

02:20.030 --> 02:27.560
Well the index is this ID so a property of this component which stores the ID loaded which is encoded

02:27.560 --> 02:37.220
in the U R L and then we have the updated recipe which is just this recipe for him value just like before

02:37.310 --> 02:39.220
when we used to service.

02:39.230 --> 02:41.950
And with that we can get rid of that service method.

02:42.170 --> 02:49.250
I'm now simply passing this javascript object and that actually already is all.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.900
Now let me also dispatch Avello here.

02:51.910 --> 02:59.630
This store dispatch new recipe actions and recipe.

03:00.190 --> 03:03.580
And here we simply need to pass the recipe we want to create.

03:03.580 --> 03:06.550
This is just a recipe for in value again.

03:07.690 --> 03:09.430
So that should be all.

03:09.430 --> 03:14.220
All the other parts here are form related and shouldn't be relevant to us here.

03:14.500 --> 03:18.280
Well maybe except for one thing here.

03:18.370 --> 03:23.110
When we initialize the form and fetched the recipe for which you want to do that.

03:23.560 --> 03:29.580
Well here we can of course again select the slice so we can reach out to our store.

03:29.590 --> 03:31.900
Select the recipes feature.

03:32.050 --> 03:43.710
Take one and then subscribe so that we now get the recipe state in the end which is of type from recipe

03:43.890 --> 03:49.030
state which you can now use to extract the recipe we're working on.

03:49.280 --> 03:57.270
So a recipe we're working on can be the recipes state there all the recipes and no access to what we

03:57.270 --> 03:58.840
stored in this ID.

03:58.890 --> 04:04.740
So the recipe at this index and again this idea is a property of this component which we set at the

04:04.740 --> 04:08.090
point of time we're loading this component or to be precise.

04:08.160 --> 04:13.800
When average years our parents change so now we're loading this down here.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.140
And set a constant equal to this.

04:17.170 --> 04:22.480
I can't get rid of this row now or if this line does however would not work like this because that's

04:22.540 --> 04:23.880
asynchronous code.

04:23.950 --> 04:28.840
So we have to move all that code here in two days.

04:28.840 --> 04:33.200
Subscribe method so that it runs after we fetched a recipe.

04:33.580 --> 04:35.500
And with that let's see if that works.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.930
So go back to your quick new recipe.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.740
Well first I need to log in though.

04:40.120 --> 04:48.430
So go back there new recipe that works let's edit the recipe by clicking on it and call it clicking

04:48.640 --> 04:50.440
edit recipe.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.370
Now this seems to work too.

04:52.630 --> 04:59.570
Let's add a couple of exclamation marks here and maybe add a new ingredient like salad.

05:00.430 --> 05:04.960
One let's click save.

05:05.090 --> 05:05.850
This works.

05:05.850 --> 05:09.040
The ingredients work if we add them to the shopping list.

05:09.080 --> 05:09.950
Does all that work.

05:09.950 --> 05:10.970
That's great.

05:11.420 --> 05:13.780
Let's add a new recipe to see if that all works.

05:13.780 --> 05:21.530
I'll just add a tested recipe add no image you're just some dummy text and sometimes the dummy description

05:21.530 --> 05:24.490
and click save and does all the work.

05:24.590 --> 05:29.840
Of course it's a bit broken because it has a lot of invalid inputs here or no valid image and so on.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.780
But overall it works.

05:31.820 --> 05:38.330
So that's super useful editing or creating recipes works as intended.

05:38.330 --> 05:42.220
Now let's move on and see what else we can do related to recipes.
