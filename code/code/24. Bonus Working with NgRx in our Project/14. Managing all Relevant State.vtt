00:02.120 --> 00:09.500
At the end of the last lecture we get this error here whereas somehow we get an error that we have no

00:09.500 --> 00:10.940
form controls.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.920
Now what's causing that.

00:13.940 --> 00:22.550
Keep in mind this error occurred when we laid around here went to recipes and went back we added some

00:22.550 --> 00:25.280
recipes but that didn't make the difference.

00:25.280 --> 00:29.590
Editing something leaving the page and coming back Costus error.

00:29.660 --> 00:30.870
Do you know why.

00:33.060 --> 00:42.600
The issue is if we do added an item by calling update ingredient we don't actually exit out of edit

00:42.600 --> 00:43.230
mode.

00:43.230 --> 00:46.570
We don't set our edited ingredient back to NULL.

00:46.590 --> 00:50.130
We don't set the index back to minus 1.

00:50.160 --> 00:59.430
So what we need to do is when editing an ingredient no matter if we do is because we updated it or deleted

00:59.430 --> 01:00.030
it.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.100
We need to reset that information here.

01:03.300 --> 01:11.550
So for example for update ingredient here all that all the said edited Ingredion back to null and added

01:11.550 --> 01:15.160
an ingredient index back to minus one.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.400
And I'll do the very same for deleting it.

01:19.410 --> 01:29.300
Now let's save this and see what this changes by Update does that all still seems to work deleting works

01:29.300 --> 01:30.020
too.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.820
But now if I navigate back and forth we still get that error.

01:34.860 --> 01:44.640
So that was day at well the issue is we only reset if I click Update or delete only if we trigger any

01:44.640 --> 01:46.670
of these two actions update or delete.

01:46.670 --> 01:53.160
This is when we update the state we need a new action which is actually dispatched whenever we leave

01:53.190 --> 02:00.330
the page 2 and I'll set it up in actions or duplicate starred action as a start address and call it

02:00.420 --> 02:01.660
stop at it.

02:01.800 --> 02:06.630
That will all be my strong value for it is actually now all.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.110
Copy that class here.

02:10.140 --> 02:11.310
Remove the constructor.

02:11.310 --> 02:18.810
I don't need a payload and call it stop added assignees stop added value here and also added to this

02:18.810 --> 02:26.400
Bondel to have an easy overview over all the actions we export or have here stop and it will be handled

02:26.400 --> 02:30.620
in my reducers then I'll add it to your shopping list actions.

02:31.480 --> 02:42.270
Stop at it and there I simply want you return to state where I said edited ingredient to null and payload

02:42.270 --> 02:46.500
or suzerainty index to minus one to reset it here too.

02:46.980 --> 02:55.740
And now with dead I can go to my shopping edit component and here an NGO undestroyed.

02:55.940 --> 03:09.330
I want to simply call this store dispatch new shopping list actions stop added like dead and now we

03:09.330 --> 03:10.320
should have fixed it.

03:10.320 --> 03:17.520
Now if you go back to the application select an item here and leave it select that navigate away and

03:17.520 --> 03:18.650
come back.

03:18.660 --> 03:26.970
Now it's working because we exited added mode and now this should all work just fine.

03:26.970 --> 03:33.420
We now navigate around added I'd add items to it go there click on them.

03:33.420 --> 03:40.740
This should now all work just fine because now we get this configured in a way that we manage everything

03:40.860 --> 03:48.150
in NDR X that cleanly start and stop editing and that our components can focus on the logic related

03:48.150 --> 03:53.710
to displaying the content whilst we manage our data in our energy our next story.
