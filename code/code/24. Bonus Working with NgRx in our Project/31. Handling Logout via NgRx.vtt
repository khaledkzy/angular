00:02.160 --> 00:04.560
We're doing a lot of things in our application.

00:04.560 --> 00:08.780
However there's one thing we don't do yet in the head component.

00:09.030 --> 00:16.350
If we click lock out we execute on log out and there we use deal of service.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.320
Now I don't want to use the off service here.

00:19.470 --> 00:25.830
Instead I want to do this directly from within my component so that I can get rid of the off service

00:26.400 --> 00:33.120
so CAPTUS code from here go to the head or component and in all log out of directory say this store

00:33.120 --> 00:44.310
dispatch log out and or copy the import from of actions into my head or component right before right

00:44.370 --> 00:46.200
after our imports here.

00:46.530 --> 00:49.620
So all the actions I need you are just the POF of course.

00:49.620 --> 00:53.370
It's from the off folder like this.

00:53.370 --> 00:56.330
And now I can dispatches here.

00:56.330 --> 00:59.530
This means that the service isn't getting used anymore.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.440
So we can simply delete that from here.

01:02.760 --> 01:08.930
And for our core module where we no longer need to provide it we can't get rid of the imports here too.

01:09.120 --> 01:14.910
Of course we all can now get rid of the import in the hetero component and any place where we might

01:14.910 --> 01:15.920
have used it.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.330
We don't need to inject it there anymore too.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.660
So let's save this and let's see where else did we use it.

01:22.660 --> 01:28.990
Worst is coming from probably just an era of the ideal as I'll just reject the restart and Reserve and

01:28.990 --> 01:32.880
see if we get any errors where we don't find the off service.

01:32.890 --> 01:35.840
So now with that finished let's see where is that missing.

01:36.070 --> 01:39.940
We're missing it in the data storage service.

01:40.150 --> 01:44.720
So let's head over there Judy.

01:44.860 --> 01:52.230
Data storage service and let's get rid of the of services import and of the injection year because we

01:52.230 --> 01:53.260
don't need it anymore.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.360
We're not using it anyways.

01:55.530 --> 02:00.780
So with that that's now working again the whole application seems to be working again.

02:00.880 --> 02:09.300
But now we're managing all relevant to related to of indication through Engy our ex and especially useful

02:09.410 --> 02:11.080
the effects module here.
