00:02.200 --> 00:10.390
In the last lecture we added our first side effect off sign up and then note it can be hard to grasp

00:10.390 --> 00:12.100
the idea behind effects.

00:12.220 --> 00:17.510
In the end it's like a reducer but a reduced way you don't change to state where you want to do other

00:17.590 --> 00:19.400
things instead.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.330
So here's your challenge.

00:21.460 --> 00:21.970
Right.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.870
And hook up your own side effect for signing in.

00:25.870 --> 00:28.240
It's pretty similar to this one.

00:28.300 --> 00:33.280
You can have a look at the off service to see which code we execute and the sign and user method here.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.790
And with that you should have all you need so good luck with that.

00:36.970 --> 00:42.340
If you're facing any issues of course we'll solve that together in a couple of seconds where you can

00:42.340 --> 00:48.470
now post a video and try it on your own.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.580
So where are you successful.

00:50.610 --> 00:54.510
Let's add our own new effect for signing in.

00:54.720 --> 01:02.640
That is right below the off sign up and I'll name it of sign in our ad at effect without the dispatch

01:02.640 --> 01:03.400
option.

01:03.420 --> 01:09.630
But with parentheses because here I want to dispatch Naqshbandi and so boneset dispatched to fault's

01:10.400 --> 01:14.940
now OFF-SIDE in again starts with checking directions here.

01:14.970 --> 01:22.170
So these actions and check of typed to see if it is often Speth a special type.

01:22.170 --> 01:24.030
We need to create that action type.

01:24.030 --> 01:27.460
First of all so any off actions file.

01:27.750 --> 01:34.540
I'll add a new action on store a unique identifier and a new constant which I named try.

01:34.570 --> 01:37.930
Sign in sign like that.

01:38.010 --> 01:38.740
Whoops.

01:38.940 --> 01:41.940
Try sign in like that.

01:41.940 --> 01:49.410
With that I'll also copy my try to sign up class here and rename it to try sign in change the unique

01:49.410 --> 01:55.710
identifier to try sign in but leave the payload as it is because we need the username and password for

01:55.710 --> 02:00.760
signing into all attitude is export the list here at the bottom though.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.550
Try sign.

02:02.940 --> 02:06.300
Sign in with that we trade in you action.

02:06.330 --> 02:11.240
Let's go back to defects and see if that occurs with all actions.

02:11.460 --> 02:17.730
Try to sign in use the is constant here because we're looking for the string.

02:18.420 --> 02:24.240
So now let's change some operators and I can actually copy the setup here from off Sign-Up because a

02:24.240 --> 02:28.640
lot is the same I'll copy it here.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.440
First of all I want to map my action and retrieve the payload.

02:32.800 --> 02:39.410
Then I want to send the request to firebase but not to create user but to sign in with email and password.

02:39.460 --> 02:43.590
The arguments still are username which is email and password though.

02:43.960 --> 02:49.820
Then we switch map again and get the token and then we merge map to admit.

02:49.930 --> 02:55.950
Well in this case sign in and set a token then that actually is already everything we need.

02:55.990 --> 02:59.630
Well the remaining thing is to hook it up and you sign in component.

02:59.830 --> 03:04.860
So there I will no longer inject the off service but instead the store.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.450
And you saw that before type store.

03:07.450 --> 03:15.000
Make sure to add the import from an energy drinks store and copy the imports from the sign up component

03:15.040 --> 03:21.160
because it's exactly the same I need here for one I need to set the state of my application state by

03:21.160 --> 03:24.030
accessing from app App State.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.090
And then here I want to dispatch this.

03:26.110 --> 03:37.870
So I will say this store site is store dispatch and now new of actions sign up like this and pass an

03:37.870 --> 03:43.200
object to it where I say username is the email and password is.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.460
Well the password.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.410
So that's it.

03:46.450 --> 03:49.350
With that we are dispatching those action.

03:49.420 --> 03:52.570
We should dispatch sign in action here though.

03:53.540 --> 03:55.510
And that should work.

03:55.520 --> 04:01.790
It's true isn't it and of course Sorriso try assigning it with username and password.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.770
And with that now if it's safe this should already be everything we need.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.100
Let's try this out.

04:07.190 --> 04:12.780
If we log in here like that you see this changes.

04:12.910 --> 04:14.920
We're not getting redirected anymore though.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.290
And for a good reason we'll come back to this in a second.

04:18.520 --> 04:25.180
But if we actually delete something here let's see if the token was set and so on let's fetch data seems

04:25.180 --> 04:25.950
to work.

04:26.230 --> 04:28.630
So why weren't we redirected.

04:29.050 --> 04:33.010
Because we're not routing and our off effects we're just.

04:33.010 --> 04:40.440
Well returning a new action in the end here in the off service though we also did navigate well that's

04:40.490 --> 04:41.660
super Super-AIDS to change.

04:41.660 --> 04:42.480
Try it on your own.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.710
We'll do it together in the next lecture.
