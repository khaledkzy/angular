00:02.240 --> 00:08.200
Let's start by adding and you fall to the off area or to be precise a new directory first which will

00:08.210 --> 00:13.430
also named store to store my i n g are X related files in there.

00:13.430 --> 00:21.710
And the first fall will be my reducers falls all named the fault of reducers dot TS Of course you could

00:21.710 --> 00:25.850
also just name it all reducers since you only have one reducer function there.

00:25.910 --> 00:30.410
But my argument is that in that function we got multiple reducers cases.

00:30.410 --> 00:39.710
So I'll create that file there and in there all export a function D or reduce or function this function

00:39.710 --> 00:47.900
will take two inputs state and D dispatched action and then in there we again will have to return our

00:47.900 --> 00:48.800
new state.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.730
So that's the basic setup.

00:51.050 --> 00:56.450
Now I ask before I want to set up an initial state for this area of the application.

00:56.720 --> 01:03.770
If we have a look at the shopping list store folder there at the reducers there we see that we created

01:03.830 --> 01:10.730
this initial state by creating a constant initial state which simply uses our own interface type which

01:10.730 --> 01:12.820
defines the shape of the state.

01:13.160 --> 01:18.680
And then we also export an app state which kind of bundles our application wide state.

01:18.680 --> 01:23.060
Now that's something I'll work on once we got multiple areas in the application.

01:23.090 --> 01:29.650
For now I want to copy the state interface and the initial state so copy both in the shopping list reduce

01:29.680 --> 01:33.620
file and copy it over to the offerings use Rafal.

01:33.620 --> 01:38.540
Now of course there I don't work with ingredients or stuff like that but there are two things I want

01:38.540 --> 01:43.250
to set up in this state stay for now that will be my token which is a string.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.820
So that is Jason.

01:44.830 --> 01:52.910
Can we get through firebase and it will be the authenticated property which is a Boolean either true

01:52.940 --> 02:05.680
or false in the initial state token Shelby null and authenticated shall Shelby false because every user

02:05.680 --> 02:08.260
should not be authenticated at the start.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.920
We can then set the state equal to the initial state.

02:10.920 --> 02:14.430
Now reducer so that we start with this state.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.880
So this is the initial set up I want to start with here.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.720
Now that's city state.

02:20.950 --> 02:29.140
Let's now bundle this all together to one single app state and for that I'll go into my folder.

02:29.140 --> 02:36.400
You're in the shared folder or in the main folder in the main folder and under the app folder directly

02:36.640 --> 02:40.220
I'll create a new folder to store folder too.

02:40.270 --> 02:44.990
So this will be the application wide store you could say and in there I want to create and you follow

02:44.990 --> 02:47.770
it on the app reducer.

02:47.970 --> 02:50.760
Yes in debt file.

02:50.770 --> 02:56.810
I simply want to export global application wide reducer in the end.

02:56.920 --> 03:03.240
So here the goal is to export a state which bundles all the other application states.

03:03.240 --> 03:09.970
Therefore I'll take the interface I have in my shopping list reducer and cutted from there and add it

03:09.970 --> 03:12.020
to the app reducer for now.

03:12.280 --> 03:18.880
Here I got the shopping list state and of course for that I need to import my shopping list reduce or

03:18.880 --> 03:19.510
fall.

03:19.520 --> 03:30.600
So import everything from that file as let's say from shopping list from the shopping list reduce Rafal.

03:30.610 --> 03:37.810
So from the one up level up from the shopping list folder from the store folder there and there the

03:37.810 --> 03:39.200
reducers fall.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.070
And with that you can extract the state.

03:41.080 --> 03:46.600
We set up there by accessing this from a shopping list object which handles all the exports from that

03:46.600 --> 03:49.640
file and accessing state here.

03:50.020 --> 03:57.520
Now a second will be off state just name it all three are and I'll add a number in word or name it from

03:57.600 --> 04:04.390
off does object which unloads all the imports and you're of course reach out to the office section there

04:04.390 --> 04:07.600
to the store fall and then be off reducers.

04:07.600 --> 04:11.220
So here I can also import from of state.

04:11.220 --> 04:17.680
And with that I got one global app state which has two areas shopping list and off we had shopping list

04:17.680 --> 04:18.320
before.

04:18.400 --> 04:23.890
Now we added a new one and we store it in a new central place which makes more sense than inside the

04:23.890 --> 04:25.950
shopping list reducers fall.

04:26.140 --> 04:32.140
Now with that being exported here we of course have to adjust the imports in the places where we use

04:32.170 --> 04:32.840
debt.

04:33.010 --> 04:39.220
So in the places where we actually wanted to use debt state definition like any shopping list component

04:39.730 --> 04:46.320
here we no longer have to import the shopping lists actions here to access yeps state.

04:46.330 --> 04:56.740
We have to add a new import everything else from and maybe from and now go up to the root level here

04:56.740 --> 05:04.360
to just store folder and the app reducers and now we can say from app designers how we now access our

05:04.360 --> 05:06.010
global state.

05:06.010 --> 05:10.300
It also allows us to remove as from a shopping list import here.

05:10.360 --> 05:16.940
We can also move on this try as a side note not as I see it the same for shopping added here.

05:16.940 --> 05:26.900
Also at this new import you have to go up one additional level though and with that replays this statist

05:26.960 --> 05:27.760
definition here.

05:27.770 --> 05:34.190
Q From app and then the App State referencing this new file getting rid of the old unnecessary import

05:34.580 --> 05:43.040
the same for recipes here and the recipe detail where we also use that lets add does import need to

05:43.040 --> 05:50.390
go up one additional level here to and now replace from shopping list here with from app to since we

05:50.390 --> 05:51.640
used moved.

05:51.650 --> 05:55.370
This App State so lets remove the import here too.

05:55.460 --> 05:57.550
And with that we now bundled the reducers.

05:57.740 --> 06:02.810
Even though our offer reducer of course doesn't do much yet we'll work on this next.
