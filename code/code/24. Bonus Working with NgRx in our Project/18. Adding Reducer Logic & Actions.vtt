00:02.400 --> 00:09.100
We created reactions Let's now define some cases or check for actions in the reducer.

00:09.120 --> 00:20.310
First of all are important reactions so import everything as of actions from of reducers file of actions

00:20.310 --> 00:21.590
fall excuse me.

00:21.930 --> 00:27.610
And now when I use that action will be of type of actions of actions.

00:27.690 --> 00:35.410
So all that combined type export we set up in the file just to make sure it's pretty clear does export

00:35.410 --> 00:35.660
here.

00:35.670 --> 00:40.120
This combined type that is the type of reaction we receive here.

00:40.400 --> 00:46.120
Now I want to create the switch case statement and I want to switch the action type.

00:46.150 --> 00:52.390
This is what I check and I'll switch different cases like the case that we have a type of off actions

00:52.600 --> 00:54.590
sign up like that.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.720
The question is what will be our state then.

00:58.090 --> 01:04.530
Well I'll return a new object as a state where I distribute all the old state properties by using the

01:04.540 --> 01:07.310
spread operator as used before.

01:07.570 --> 01:14.110
But then all set authenticated to true because now we are often dictated.

01:14.260 --> 01:22.060
This is the first step or the first case actually I'll do the same when we're signing in so I can simply

01:22.060 --> 01:28.900
combine them and take advantage of the fall through mechanism which means if we don't break or return

01:28.930 --> 01:35.470
in one case the next fitting case will be executed to Europe taking advantage by placing us directly

01:35.470 --> 01:41.460
below sign up so that both cases will actually be handling the same code.

01:41.590 --> 01:45.130
This one here of course it's a different story.

01:45.130 --> 01:47.770
If we have a lockout action.

01:47.890 --> 01:55.360
So for log out we actually want to return a new state to and there the state will simply be any old

01:55.360 --> 02:03.040
state we might have but token will be set to NULL and authenticated will be set to false.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.950
So this is the log outstate.

02:05.980 --> 02:12.300
And finally we get a default state or just return the unchanged state like that.

02:12.370 --> 02:16.420
That of course means you can get rid of the statement here at the end.

02:16.450 --> 02:18.520
This is the finished producer.

02:18.610 --> 02:25.720
The next step is to add this to our store our application wide store which we configure an app module

02:26.170 --> 02:31.780
and then make sure that we actually can select slices from that store and dispatch actions.

02:31.780 --> 02:33.540
So let's work on this next.
