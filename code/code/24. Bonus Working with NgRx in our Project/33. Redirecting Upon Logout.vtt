00:02.200 --> 00:06.660
So were you able to implement this redirect upon log out functionality.

00:06.880 --> 00:12.100
Let's do it together or add a new side effect with an effect here.

00:12.250 --> 00:20.260
And I'm actually at this con think object where I set dispatch to Forth because I don't plan on dispatching

00:20.320 --> 00:27.520
a new action at the end of this effect all nameless property of log out and I'll start by listening

00:27.520 --> 00:32.610
for actions with off type I can check if the action is of type log out.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.270
So of type log out like that if it is I want you to do.

00:37.270 --> 00:39.660
Operator to just do something.

00:39.690 --> 00:46.300
And here's an important spot you could think that we can subscribe here because we do have an observable

00:46.300 --> 00:48.780
right we could call subscribe here.

00:49.120 --> 00:56.340
However we still need to let this return or resold to an observable in the end.

00:56.560 --> 01:02.890
Because Engy are x internally still needs to keep that absorbable going in the end it also needs to

01:02.890 --> 01:05.140
run it from the reducer you remember.

01:05.440 --> 01:10.560
So we should just get into this chain and not finish it with subscribe.

01:10.930 --> 01:13.380
So do is the perfect operator for this.

01:13.390 --> 01:18.540
It allows us to execute code without hindering the other part.

01:18.550 --> 01:26.660
Q To continue I need to unlock do salt simply W.K. it does import here and import do from our ex-chief

01:26.680 --> 01:27.100
Yes.

01:27.120 --> 01:32.980
Slash slash operator slash do so with this import added it's unlocked.

01:33.280 --> 01:41.840
And now here I can simply say this router navigate and navigate to the drought for example.

01:42.050 --> 01:44.350
Well let's save this and see if it works.

01:44.410 --> 01:51.890
If I do log in here and I go to recipe's new recipe and I click log out.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.920
I'm logged out as you can tell by the header.

01:55.010 --> 01:56.390
And we were redirected.

01:56.390 --> 01:58.220
So this is no working too.

01:58.280 --> 02:01.370
And with that we should have everything about a indication finished.
