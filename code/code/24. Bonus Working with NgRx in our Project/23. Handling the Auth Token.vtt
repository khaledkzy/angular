End the last lecture we realized that setting the totem doesn't seem to work.

00:06.830 --> 00:09.280
Did you find out why it doesn't work.

00:10.540 --> 00:16.000
While we can see the issue if we switch to our off reducers we're simply not handling these sets.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.290
Token case.

00:17.590 --> 00:21.520
So let's add that case and let's handle all actions.

00:21.700 --> 00:28.210
Set token here so that we do actually alter the state once token is set.

00:28.210 --> 00:35.770
In this case I want to leave the state as it is of course I want to set the token equal to my payload

00:36.160 --> 00:41.660
to action payload here because in this case the action will have a payload.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.410
We are passing it.

00:43.630 --> 00:46.160
This should actually be all.

00:46.240 --> 00:51.460
However there is one other thing we can also improve in the off service on sign up.

00:51.520 --> 00:55.810
We do change your FINUCAN it but we never get to talk here.

00:56.050 --> 01:03.040
So while we should indeed use here or indeed do here is we should also get to talk in here.

01:03.040 --> 01:10.000
So we should basically copy the code from the sign in case your where we reach out to firebase to get

01:10.000 --> 01:13.220
the token and then dispatch said token to.

01:13.540 --> 01:22.840
Now with this in place if we now reload and we do log in here let's go to the list and delete the recipe

01:22.840 --> 01:25.030
and let's try fetching it now.

01:25.060 --> 01:29.980
Now this works because now we are setting the token we are fetching it.

01:30.310 --> 01:38.680
Now on the other hand if we log out upon clicking log out so we get this strange error that the request

01:38.680 --> 01:43.330
wasn't sent successfully because you were on offer us which makes sense because the token is null.

01:43.340 --> 01:48.460
But why did our app try to send this request here.

01:48.820 --> 01:52.780
Think about this issue and see if you can find root for this problem.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.920
We'll solve it together in the next lecture.
