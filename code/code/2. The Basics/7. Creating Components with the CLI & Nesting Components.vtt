In the last lectures we learn a lot including the creation of a new component by hand.

00:08.940 --> 00:15.300
Now there also is an alternative to creating it manually when using the Seelye you can open a new terminal

00:15.300 --> 00:18.470
window or command line Leave the end user window running.

00:18.470 --> 00:20.470
That's important don't close it.

00:20.490 --> 00:26.440
And in this new window we can use some steel I command to also create a new component.

00:26.640 --> 00:34.110
Let's say we want to have our single server components here in a number of components are nested into

00:34.110 --> 00:40.320
a number of component servers multiple servers component.

00:40.380 --> 00:46.500
We can create this manually by adding a service folder with our component or we use to see light with

00:46.590 --> 00:54.780
energy and there we have a generate command which allows us to generate some elements some elements

00:54.780 --> 00:56.790
supported by angler.

00:56.940 --> 01:03.420
One such element is a component so we can create a new component with energy generated component and

01:03.420 --> 01:07.830
then passing the name service like this.

01:07.830 --> 01:15.990
You can also use a shortcut and instead of energy generated component you could say Engy G C which does

01:15.990 --> 01:17.580
the same.

01:17.580 --> 01:23.940
So if you hit enter what this will do is it will give you a new folder in your app folder with the name

01:23.940 --> 01:25.780
of your component servers.

01:26.130 --> 01:33.060
And then there you basically find the same files as you had for the app component aged LCS as TS enters

01:33.120 --> 01:37.160
Spack file which basically is used for testing.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.670
Now I will remove this.

01:38.670 --> 01:45.120
We will later have a section about testing and we'll have a look at restyling later too.

01:45.150 --> 01:52.770
For now let's say it is in this service component that we want to output our single server.

01:53.040 --> 01:58.110
Well we already have this decorator selector app server.

01:58.380 --> 02:05.580
So in this template of the service component we can override the default text with app server and maybe

02:05.580 --> 02:11.250
simply replicate this so that we have two components because remember components are reusable.

02:11.250 --> 02:17.610
We can use the same component as often as we want by simply using it selector as often as we want.

02:17.920 --> 02:25.500
So now we have two service here and with this in our service component you need to make sure that you

02:25.500 --> 02:27.770
always update the app module.

02:27.780 --> 02:33.510
Now do you see I should do this automatically which is why you already find the import and declaration

02:33.510 --> 02:34.480
in this file.

02:34.650 --> 02:37.460
But make sure you really do have it here.

02:38.010 --> 02:44.610
With this we can go to our service component types and fault to check the selector which is app dash

02:44.730 --> 02:52.080
service and then we can go to our app team of our app component HMO file and update deselected to use

02:52.080 --> 02:55.310
this new component instead of the old one.

02:55.410 --> 03:01.290
With this if we now save this and go back to our application it looks almost the same as before we see

03:01.290 --> 03:03.910
our a single server component twice.

03:04.200 --> 03:11.430
But if we inspect the code here in the developer tools of chrome for example you'll see that we have

03:11.430 --> 03:16.050
this our app servers component to this newly created component.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.720
And in between we have two single AB server components.

03:20.730 --> 03:25.710
So with that we learned a couple of important things about how to create components manually or with

03:25.740 --> 03:32.160
to Selye how we can nest them into each other that we can use components selectors in any Obert template

03:32.160 --> 03:39.110
of any other component and how we can replicate components by simply using them.

03:39.150 --> 03:42.530
Well multiple times using their selectors multiple times.

03:42.960 --> 03:47.940
Let's dive into how we can actually style them what you can do regarding the style and the template

03:47.940 --> 03:48.740
of components.
