00:02.500 --> 00:05.190
So with all four forms of data binding covered.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.400
Now let's finish our little demo app for now.

00:08.590 --> 00:11.210
We get the server name and this is life update.

00:11.230 --> 00:18.920
Whilst we type due to two data binding in place here I will comment out does server name here instead.

00:18.970 --> 00:20.560
I want to display the server name.

00:20.590 --> 00:23.520
Once we clicked this add server button.

00:23.770 --> 00:31.030
So once we create the server we should not only say server was created but also name is and then simply

00:31.060 --> 00:34.360
add does server name like this.

00:34.360 --> 00:41.320
So now with this in place we're now using the data we're changing data binding or if we chose to do

00:41.320 --> 00:46.600
so from one way data binding for use the other approach which is currently commented out and we have

00:46.600 --> 00:52.780
this in place now you can see that if I change the server name like this and click add server we see

00:52.780 --> 00:56.100
Suro was created name is test server 2.

00:56.440 --> 01:02.260
With that we're using all four forms of data mining to gabber with a jobber event pointing to listen

01:02.260 --> 01:05.070
to the click string and tribulation to output the data.

01:05.080 --> 01:11.680
Here property binding to and able to spot in the first place after two seconds and two were binding

01:11.770 --> 01:13.720
to fetch our input data.

01:14.050 --> 01:18.730
So with that we're pretty advanced into the basics of angular.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.760
We use components we know how they work in general.

01:21.760 --> 01:27.430
We use how to communicate with our templates from our types could code and in Yabrud direction.

01:27.430 --> 01:34.300
Now there is one more basic feature we have to cover to really be able to build first little applications

01:34.390 --> 01:38.130
before we then can dive deeper into the individual building blocks.

01:38.140 --> 01:44.450
So let's have a look at this next feature soon directives for that time to practice data mining though.
