00:02.730 --> 00:05.440
Now are you already a component ninja.

00:05.640 --> 00:12.820
We learned a lot about components about the templates options we have there and about the styles I want

00:12.820 --> 00:17.480
and focus on the last property we see in this component decorator for now.

00:17.670 --> 00:26.310
The selector I already mentioned that this has to be a unique selector so that you don't override accidentally

00:26.550 --> 00:33.450
an already existing element or maybe a component made available by a number of third party package you

00:33.450 --> 00:35.790
use in your project.

00:35.790 --> 00:38.000
There's one other piece of information about the selector.

00:38.000 --> 00:47.430
Though you don't have to use this type of selector right now our selector is the same selector as we

00:47.430 --> 00:48.840
use it in C..

00:48.870 --> 00:57.210
As for selecting element so we have app server this year as the element and this is recognized by angular

00:57.600 --> 01:04.050
because the selector we chose is app servers and this basically just looks how you use select elements

01:04.050 --> 01:05.490
in C S S right.

01:05.490 --> 01:09.950
We select the age tree element by just typing Atri here.

01:10.110 --> 01:17.460
We select the app service element by just typing app service here.

01:17.820 --> 01:26.840
So that actually works Legacy's as selector and therefore you are not limited to selecting by element.

01:27.120 --> 01:33.620
You could put this into square brackets to use the attribute selector.

01:33.690 --> 01:40.190
So in Zia's as you can select elements by attribute by enclosing that attribute in square brackets.

01:40.650 --> 01:48.150
And now if you save this you would see that our app actually is broken because if we have a look at

01:48.150 --> 01:56.670
the error message app servers it's an unknown element because now our code angler doesn't recognize

01:56.700 --> 02:02.330
app service anymore because we changed the selector to be an attribute.

02:02.400 --> 02:08.220
So to make this work again we would have to comment this out or remove it and maybe add a div or any

02:08.220 --> 02:15.120
other element a normal aged human element which has the app servers attribute now.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.240
Now with days custom attribute added now.

02:18.300 --> 02:25.170
Now the Eberts again because now angler's selects the element by attribute and not by the element itself

02:25.200 --> 02:33.630
because we changed the selector and Navier alternative is to select by and I'm just going to comment

02:33.630 --> 02:38.630
this out so that the code is still there for reference to select by class.

02:38.640 --> 02:44.120
So with a dot at the beginning app servers again just like in C S S.

02:44.160 --> 02:48.120
So here we can now select by class.

02:48.120 --> 02:54.600
So let's add a new day of the year which has a class of app servers which we of course could now also

02:54.630 --> 02:55.380
style.

02:55.410 --> 03:02.240
But besides that it's also recognized by Engler as a selector which is why we still see the app.

03:02.490 --> 03:04.460
Now these are all options you have.

03:04.740 --> 03:12.330
As a side note selecting by ID won't work that's not supported by angular and all those pseudo selectors

03:12.390 --> 03:19.170
like hover and so on also don't work and you typically use the elements style here.

03:19.310 --> 03:21.750
App servers for components.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.820
We will soon learn about directives.

03:23.830 --> 03:25.920
Another feature where this is different.

03:26.100 --> 03:33.360
But for components you typically create your own elements and therefore you don't use that style and

03:33.360 --> 03:36.140
you don't use the attribute style.

03:36.180 --> 03:43.530
Instead you use app Cirus like element but it is important to understand that you are not limited to

03:43.530 --> 03:43.840
this.

03:43.860 --> 03:47.750
And there might be use cases where you want to use a different selector
