Indie example application we book thus far we haven't used any directives besides components which are

00:09.320 --> 00:12.850
directives that's important but we haven't used any Obert directives.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.000
No built in directives.

00:15.430 --> 00:23.400
No let's say one thing we want to do is we only want to show this server was create a text here.

00:23.410 --> 00:25.360
There is no need to have this.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.460
No sir was create a text to be displayed.

00:28.840 --> 00:32.820
So would be nice if we could conditionally show this message.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.610
And for that we need some help.

00:35.710 --> 00:41.260
We can use a directive shipping with angular NGF directive.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.370
Now it works like a IF statement.

00:43.510 --> 00:50.770
And to be precise it works like this in our service component here where we output the server creation

00:50.770 --> 00:51.940
status.

00:51.940 --> 00:57.220
I would comment this out so that we can still reference the code but now I will add a new paragraph

00:57.460 --> 01:05.550
simply say server was created server name is bind my server name.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.730
Now with this in place it will still work.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.790
But now we always see with every keystroke how we change this server name not really what I want.

01:13.850 --> 01:17.610
Instead I want to output it as soon as you click this button here.

01:18.110 --> 01:22.270
So what I can do is I can add a directive here.

01:22.370 --> 01:26.930
And as I said typically directives are added by using an attribute selector.

01:26.930 --> 01:34.520
And pretty much all the built in directives used that selector and if does and then NGF is added by

01:34.520 --> 01:35.740
adding a start.

01:35.750 --> 01:36.810
This is important.

01:37.100 --> 01:45.530
And if the star is required because Engy is a structural directive which means it changes the structure

01:45.530 --> 01:50.490
of our dorm it either adds this element or it doesn't add it.

01:50.690 --> 01:53.840
So that's just some extra information for angular.

01:53.840 --> 01:58.570
The directive itself is just NGF but the start is required.

01:58.580 --> 02:00.780
Without it it will not work correctly.

02:01.680 --> 02:09.580
So Engy if and then we can set up our conditions here between the quotation marks for NGF.

02:09.660 --> 02:10.510
This has to be.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.610
Any expression returning true or false.

02:13.650 --> 02:16.670
Deciding whether this should be added or not.

02:16.710 --> 02:24.840
So here it would make sense to add a new property which we name server created and set it to false and

02:24.840 --> 02:26.850
we set this to true once the button is clicked.

02:26.850 --> 02:33.360
So here in on create server which is triggered when the button is clicked here said server created equal

02:33.860 --> 02:36.780
to true like that.

02:36.780 --> 02:42.740
Now with this we can go back to our template and simply bind NGF to server created.

02:42.870 --> 02:46.800
And again this could also call a method which returns true or false.

02:46.950 --> 02:50.240
Or directly perform the check between the quotation marks.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.390
Anything which returns true or false.

02:53.400 --> 02:58.410
Now with this if we save this what you see is that there is no text.

02:58.630 --> 03:04.350
But if a nameless tests are two and click the button now the text is added year.

03:04.560 --> 03:13.450
And the interesting thing is if I reload the app and we inspect our dorm here you'll see that our ambassador

03:13.510 --> 03:17.160
component below bloated is above that is the button.

03:17.650 --> 03:21.440
But if I click this button a new element was entered here.

03:21.470 --> 03:28.720
The paragraph and here you see kind of the hook which angle are created to know where it should be entered.

03:28.930 --> 03:34.660
But the important thing is it's really added or removed to or from the dorm.

03:34.660 --> 03:38.470
It's not there all the time it's not hidden it's just not there.

03:38.590 --> 03:40.880
Which is super important to understand.

03:41.170 --> 03:48.230
So that's NGF again to start at the beginning indicates that this is a structural directive really.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.860
Changing the dorm as you just saw
