00:02.620 --> 00:05.770
We're almost done with the basics about angular.

00:05.770 --> 00:12.350
We learned a lot about components the basic building block of any angular app about how it starts the

00:12.360 --> 00:19.900
app how we can communicate with our templates in our components so that we can output data or react

00:19.900 --> 00:21.100
to events.

00:21.100 --> 00:28.050
Now there is one average key Boulding blog you probably use and any angular app you build directives.

00:28.300 --> 00:33.910
What are their Rectus directives are instructions in the dorm.

00:33.970 --> 00:37.350
And we actually already use directives without knowing it.

00:37.390 --> 00:44.950
Components are kind of such instructions in the Dom once you place the selector off a component somewhere

00:44.950 --> 00:46.480
in our templates.

00:46.480 --> 00:53.830
At this point of time we're instructing Engler to add the content of our component template and the

00:53.830 --> 00:58.650
business logic and our types with code in this place where we use the selector.

00:58.660 --> 01:00.930
This was our instruction angler.

01:00.940 --> 01:08.050
Please add our component in this place and indeed components are directives but directives with a template

01:08.560 --> 01:12.190
there are also directives without a template.

01:12.280 --> 01:19.090
So an example would be the app turned green directive which would be a custom directive we could build

01:19.960 --> 01:24.960
we typically add directives with attributes selector.

01:24.970 --> 01:30.280
But technically the selector of a directive can be configured just like the selector of a component.

01:30.280 --> 01:33.920
So you could always use C S S classes or the elements style.

01:33.940 --> 01:37.390
But again typically use the attribute style.

01:37.660 --> 01:44.320
And on this paragraph this directive might simply colored the text green you could say so angular would

01:44.320 --> 01:52.720
find this instruction here we would have defined our directive with the directive decorator to inform

01:52.720 --> 01:55.070
angular that this class holds a directive.

01:55.270 --> 01:58.440
And there we might have the logic to turn the screen.

01:58.810 --> 02:05.440
Now we will learn how to write our own directives in D section focused on directives in this course

02:05.920 --> 02:10.290
but there are a couple of built in directives which are really useful.

02:10.430 --> 02:15.120
Let's take a closer look at how we use them and what they do for us in the next lectures.
