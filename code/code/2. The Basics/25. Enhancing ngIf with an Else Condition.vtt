00:02.440 --> 00:07.980
In the last lecture we had a look at the basic NGF syntax and that's the syntax you're going to use.

00:07.980 --> 00:11.670
Most of the time there is one alternative to it though.

00:11.850 --> 00:16.910
Sometimes you have not only the if condition but also the else condition.

00:17.160 --> 00:23.640
So here we might want to say sir was created sort of a name is something with NGF but we could also

00:23.640 --> 00:27.820
add the else block where we don't want to say No sir was created.

00:27.840 --> 00:31.690
Now we deleted that exact text for the reason that we don't want to see it.

00:31.830 --> 00:34.730
But imagine that we do want to show that alternative.

00:34.740 --> 00:42.300
So no server was created could be the text here and now we want to show this paragraph only if NGF is

00:42.360 --> 00:46.230
not true or does condition server created is not true.

00:46.620 --> 00:54.900
We can achieve this by placing a local reference on these element here and local reference is something

00:54.930 --> 01:00.580
I will dive deeper into in the understanding components and data mining section this course.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.960
For now let's think of it as a marker.

01:03.150 --> 01:06.120
So I will named is no server.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.900
Any name you like.

01:08.000 --> 01:08.500
Same as.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.580
No server with a capital S..

01:10.710 --> 01:19.230
And now we need to change the paragraph you're to N-G template that as a component that directive shipping

01:19.260 --> 01:24.350
with angular which you can use to mark places in the dorm.

01:24.660 --> 01:30.190
And now I will add the paragraph back in this template with the text in between like this.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.750
So now basically the text you want the output.

01:32.820 --> 01:39.330
And now with Engy template with the local reference a marker on it we mark a certain spot in the template

01:39.390 --> 01:42.540
which we want to show conditionally.

01:42.540 --> 01:50.330
Now to show it conditionally we simply enhance NGF by also adding else and then no server.

01:50.370 --> 01:57.810
So this marker we placed on Engy template and that's all the index we need if we save this you see no

01:57.810 --> 01:59.280
server was created.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.820
And as soon as I click here that gets replaced with server was created.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.210
So that is energy if else a nice lil addition in a use case where you have.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.050
Well an else condition.

02:10.200 --> 02:15.860
Of course the alternative would always be to simply use Engy if we have the reversed check.

02:15.900 --> 02:18.480
So with exclamation marks are created.

02:18.690 --> 02:21.810
But that here is another nice alternative.

02:21.810 --> 02:23.830
Now I'm going to delete it.

02:23.850 --> 02:29.160
You will find an article after the section you have though where you can find this code again and get

02:29.160 --> 02:34.940
kids who are interested and will also use this code in the course project we're going to build.

02:35.190 --> 02:39.510
I just wanted to highlight that this option exists using energy of light.

02:39.510 --> 02:42.570
This however is DKs you will see most of it.

02:42.600 --> 02:43.590
Now let's continue
