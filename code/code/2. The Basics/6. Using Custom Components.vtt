00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.040
With our component registered let's use it.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.690
So we have our selector here observer.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.620
Now I told you we are not going to add to the index HMO file there it wouldn't work.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.110
Instead let's go to the component age team I'll file the only average team of all we have right now

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.660
were where we could edit.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.250
And here I'll add a horizontal line and Lotus.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.800
I'll add my app server element here and the shortcut I used here is just a little plug in called Emett

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.720
available for many ideas and editors which gives you a quicker way of writing.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.380
Tim.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.630
So here app server is our own select or our own element kind of recreate it.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.130
If we now save this it should successfully recompile.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.550
And if we have a look at our running application you'll see the server component here our own component

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.460
being added here.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.670
So that is how you can use your components then with their selector offer adding them to app module

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.240
and then well displaying them on the page
