With examples for Engy style and if now something relate to NZ style is Engy class.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.930
Now we learn that N-G style allows us to dynamically assign a style.

00:15.970 --> 00:23.500
Now I will also add Engy classier and we're Engy style allowed us to change to see us as style itself

00:23.830 --> 00:28.430
N-G class allows us to dynamically add or remove C S S classes.

00:28.870 --> 00:31.660
So let's create such a class in four days.

00:31.810 --> 00:34.390
First of all add my styles here.

00:35.630 --> 00:42.170
And I will use tactics to writers over multiple lines and I would give this a class name of online in

00:42.170 --> 00:48.950
which case I want to color the text white so that's all I want to do because I think it's kind of hard

00:48.950 --> 00:52.400
to read the black text on the green background.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.310
So back here N-G class also.

00:55.330 --> 01:00.250
This is the directive also only works as intended when using property binding.

01:00.350 --> 01:03.090
So let's wrap it in square brackets too.

01:03.440 --> 01:09.230
And here we also need to pass a javascript object and that's just the case for this property of this

01:09.320 --> 01:09.980
directive.

01:09.980 --> 01:16.300
Of course each property you bind to may take a different value like disabled which took true or false.

01:16.430 --> 01:21.450
So here it's a javascript object and French class object works like this.

01:21.470 --> 01:23.570
We also have key value pairs.

01:23.750 --> 01:30.980
The key is see us as class names and the values are the conditions determining whether this class should

01:30.980 --> 01:33.200
be attached or not.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.390
So here we have the online class.

01:35.390 --> 01:37.750
You could also wrap this in single quotation marks.

01:37.850 --> 01:41.690
If you had a class name with a dash inside of it or something like this.

01:42.020 --> 01:42.950
And here.

01:43.310 --> 01:44.750
Well I want to attach this.

01:44.780 --> 01:54.220
Only if the server is online so only a server status equals on line on line.

01:54.220 --> 01:57.200
Here it's a string between single quotation marks.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.420
Now of course you could also outsource this in a method you call this service status equal online check.

02:02.420 --> 02:04.610
But here I will write it inline.

02:04.970 --> 02:10.600
So if this is on line we should attach the see us as class on line to this paragraph.

02:10.670 --> 02:12.880
Our Wise's should not get attached.

02:12.890 --> 02:15.030
Let's view this in the running application.

02:15.080 --> 02:21.690
Both are off line so not that you should have T-Online see us as class added to it.

02:21.830 --> 02:26.250
And indeed I can't find a class on any of the two.

02:26.270 --> 02:30.770
Now let's reload and hope that some of them is off line or online excusing both art.

02:30.830 --> 02:32.180
So let's check it.

02:32.180 --> 02:35.180
Now we see the online class has been added.

02:36.030 --> 02:40.400
Actually to both of them because this is how Engy class works.

02:40.470 --> 02:44.680
It only adds xes as class if a certain condition is true.

02:44.850 --> 02:51.230
And that's an example for a number both in directive and not bold in attribute directive
