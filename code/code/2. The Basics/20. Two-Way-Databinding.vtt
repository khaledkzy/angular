In the last lectures we learn a lot about even finding and proper keybinding.

00:06.920 --> 00:09.150
Now let's combine both two.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.970
Two way binding.

00:11.100 --> 00:17.950
We learnt that we can get to event data like this for example there is another approach too though.

00:18.420 --> 00:25.770
If I copy this and then commented out and now replace this input event with something else you will

00:25.770 --> 00:32.150
find that we have an even easier way of binding to some data with two way data binding.

00:32.280 --> 00:35.140
We combine property and even binding.

00:35.280 --> 00:42.090
We use it therefore by combining the syntaxes square brackets and within these parentheses.

00:42.510 --> 00:50.000
Now here we have to use a special directive and we will learn more about this in a second and you model.

00:50.100 --> 00:54.300
Now we can set this equal to some property defined in our typescript code.

00:54.330 --> 00:58.880
So if to the server name for example does set up will do the following.

00:59.100 --> 01:07.910
It will trigger on the input event and update the value of server name in our component automatically.

01:08.070 --> 01:15.120
On the other hand since it is two way binding it will also update the value of the input element.

01:15.120 --> 01:22.120
If we change server name somewhere else and I can demonstrate this by going back to the typescript code

01:22.660 --> 01:26.930
and setting server name to test server here initially.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.130
So afforded was an empty string.

01:29.140 --> 01:30.820
Now it isn't anymore.

01:31.040 --> 01:37.670
With this if we go back to the running application you'll see that the input is pre-populated with debt.

01:38.050 --> 01:45.570
Now if for demo purposes I comment in the other input which does not use to a binding.

01:45.610 --> 01:49.930
You'll see that this input is empty because again it's not using to a binding.

01:49.930 --> 01:57.820
Now if I type something here you see it updates the property name and hence it updates there where we

01:57.860 --> 02:00.870
used signature pollution and the other input.

02:01.150 --> 02:07.210
But if I type here it's not getting changed and the first input because again we're not using to were

02:07.210 --> 02:08.390
binding there.

02:08.470 --> 02:14.120
This is a two way data binding is a very simple way of binding in both directions.

02:14.200 --> 02:21.510
And for example of reacting to changes in well the input value here.

02:21.510 --> 02:23.690
So I will comment out the first approach.

02:23.740 --> 02:26.110
I will leave the method in here though.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.950
Even though we're not calling it anymore.

02:28.120 --> 02:34.990
But with that you also had a look at two were binding a nice and easy way of reacting to events in both

02:34.990 --> 02:36.460
directions.

02:36.470 --> 02:39.550
Now let's find two our app here a little bit more.

02:39.610 --> 02:45.400
And let's then move on to direct this another core feature of angular
