00:02.500 --> 00:08.560
We understood that templates are important and that we can either use them in line here or point to

00:08.560 --> 00:10.150
an external file.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.700
What about styles.

00:11.710 --> 00:17.230
We also have this style or else property here and we have DS C S S files.

00:17.230 --> 00:19.080
What can we do with those.

00:19.550 --> 00:22.070
Let's go back to our app component for this.

00:22.120 --> 00:25.710
Here we got a tree tag and a horizontal line.

00:25.810 --> 00:30.120
And if we have a look at our application it's not that pretty right.

00:30.330 --> 00:37.060
The I'm in the app component text here are all the text actually is sitting right on the you're not

00:37.060 --> 00:38.640
super pretty.

00:38.830 --> 00:45.610
Now since we use bootstrap Of course we can use some bootstrap classes to enhance this so we could add

00:45.640 --> 00:49.800
a day of with our container class around it then add a row.

00:49.900 --> 00:53.490
And this is just using D.C.'s as framework bootstrap.

00:53.500 --> 00:58.400
So these are some siestas classes provided by this framework nothing angler's specific.

00:58.660 --> 01:05.080
And then we could add a column of your excess wealth to have one column on all device whiffs.

01:05.080 --> 01:12.100
Now if we add this we added some styling some normalcy as a styling nothing angler's specific.

01:12.100 --> 01:15.400
And our app looks a little bit nicer now.

01:15.490 --> 01:21.360
This is great but we can also use some tools given to us by angularity.

01:21.430 --> 01:24.990
Let's say does I'm India component heading here.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.390
We want to change that style.

01:27.590 --> 01:31.960
Maybe we want to give some blue color.

01:32.290 --> 01:39.480
We can do it just by going to the app component C S S file which defines the styling for does component.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.690
And now we can use or write normal SEUS us code.

01:42.700 --> 01:49.570
So override the style of D.H. free tag and set its color to some Baloo.

01:49.570 --> 01:52.970
So maybe Tudor's dark blue here.

01:53.230 --> 01:59.050
If we now save this and we have a look at our application you see it's dark blue.

01:59.060 --> 02:08.230
Now this is how you can use this style file this C-s as file referenced in the app component here too

02:08.240 --> 02:11.390
to find the styles for a component.

02:11.500 --> 02:20.170
Now just like we were able to choose between external file and inline code for the template we can do

02:20.170 --> 02:22.420
the same for the styling.

02:22.600 --> 02:29.310
You know does that style you or else is an array year whereas template you were a Wasn't it is this.

02:29.350 --> 02:36.290
Because we could reference multiple external style sheets here so you could add pointers to stylesheets.

02:36.790 --> 02:40.370
But besides that I'm going to comment this out.

02:40.420 --> 02:44.170
You can also set up a number property which is just styles.

02:44.200 --> 02:50.770
This also takes an array but now it takes an array of strings where you define the style in this string.

02:50.770 --> 02:57.400
So now in this file here I'm going to use back ticks again to be able to write a multi-line expression

02:57.400 --> 03:00.790
here and then we could set up a tree here.

03:00.790 --> 03:05.430
And to really show you that this is different I will set the color cube.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.390
Now let's not say dark blue but you Dodger blue.

03:10.750 --> 03:18.070
And if I now save this and we go back to the application you see the blue updated because now the inline

03:18.070 --> 03:19.470
style is taking over.

03:19.480 --> 03:25.460
I commented out the other one just like with the template you have to decide which one to use.

03:25.460 --> 03:32.290
You can't combine style or else and styles but both important here has to be an array that's different

03:32.290 --> 03:33.000
to template.

03:33.020 --> 03:40.730
You must only have one template you may have multiple style files or style definitions and you can choose

03:40.730 --> 03:43.330
between inline and extra in a file.

03:43.340 --> 03:46.370
The rules are basically the same as for template.

03:46.370 --> 03:52.970
If you have more code in there using an external file is a good idea if it's a short style definition

03:52.970 --> 03:53.670
like this.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.970
Why don't you just put it into the typescript file.

03:56.990 --> 03:59.940
This is how you can work with templates and styles
