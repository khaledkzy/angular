In last lectures we learn a lot about how we can use property binding and stringin jubilation to output

00:09.110 --> 00:10.750
data in the template.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.160
Let's now react to events.

00:12.170 --> 00:14.010
For example we have a pattern here.

00:14.180 --> 00:20.090
And after two seconds this badness enabled so would be nice we could do something once we clicked the

00:20.090 --> 00:20.890
button.

00:21.200 --> 00:27.470
Now I will soon show you how we can actually add a news server how we can add a new replication of our

00:27.560 --> 00:30.920
server a selector of our server component to year.

00:30.980 --> 00:35.440
For now what I want to do is I want to output something.

00:35.450 --> 00:41.180
I will remove this text here and instead here I want to output the value of a property or create this

00:41.180 --> 00:42.060
property.

00:42.100 --> 00:45.680
And again you make more energy on it for now I will come back to this.

00:45.740 --> 00:55.660
I will name it Server creation status and initially able to set it to no server was created like this.

00:55.660 --> 01:00.620
Now this property can be output wires string a tribulation server creation status.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.930
And I just told you I don't want to continue outputting data.

01:03.940 --> 01:05.330
We want to listen to events.

01:05.380 --> 01:07.720
So I promised it we'll do it.

01:07.870 --> 01:16.360
I will add another method below here and I will name this method on create server d on at the beginning

01:16.360 --> 01:20.750
to kind of make clear that this will be triggered from within my template.

01:20.770 --> 01:26.830
You don't have to name it on something but it kind of makes it easier to understand who will call this

01:26.830 --> 01:27.600
method.

01:27.790 --> 01:33.370
Well the user will basically by doing something some event will call it that is what I want to symbolize

01:33.370 --> 01:34.230
with that.

01:34.510 --> 01:39.770
So if you're able to set the server creation status to server was created.

01:40.270 --> 01:43.570
So the missing piece of course is to call this method.

01:43.570 --> 01:50.340
And now here is where if when binding comes into play we want to listen to this click event here.

01:50.470 --> 01:56.740
And typically you have the on click attribute on the HDMI element where you can now execute some Chalis

01:56.730 --> 01:57.550
dropped code.

01:57.670 --> 01:59.690
We won't use that with angler though.

01:59.860 --> 02:08.800
Here we have the Sendak's angler offers us event binding which uses parentheses like property binding

02:08.830 --> 02:11.800
used square brackets for events.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.190
Parentheses are a signal that we're using when binding.

02:15.490 --> 02:19.630
And here we have to specify the name of DBAN between the parentheses.

02:19.750 --> 02:28.090
For example click and you can basically bind to all the events made available by the HDMI attribute.

02:28.150 --> 02:29.740
You're placing us on.

02:29.800 --> 02:37.600
So if you have on click on mouse enter you could bind to click mouse enter without the on at the beginning.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.000
So we are blind to the click event.

02:40.090 --> 02:45.070
And now between the quotation marks we put the code we want to execute.

02:45.160 --> 02:50.290
Once this event occurs not oftentimes you will call a method here.

02:50.320 --> 02:58.690
So let's do it as LEDs point to the method we want to execute which is on create server with parentheses.

02:58.810 --> 03:02.830
So this method will now get executed whenever we click the button.

03:03.220 --> 03:06.390
As a side note you don't have to execute a method here.

03:06.430 --> 03:11.140
You could also put the code you want to execute right between quotation marks.

03:11.300 --> 03:18.100
Oftentimes this is not very good because you want to execute more code if some event happens.

03:18.100 --> 03:23.510
But if all you want to do is set some boolean property to True for example well.

03:23.620 --> 03:30.100
You can definitely do inline the template as a general rule though you shouldn't put too much logic

03:30.130 --> 03:32.200
into your templates though.

03:32.230 --> 03:39.270
So now we're binding to click event and we execute on create server method when it occurs.

03:39.270 --> 03:42.090
So let's see there's an action in our application.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.470
Let's reload the page.

03:43.510 --> 03:47.530
The button gets enabled and now watch this part here.

03:47.560 --> 03:55.620
So I click the button it changes the server was created because we are triggering our own methods here.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.270
And this is how a simple event binding works.

03:58.270 --> 03:59.870
Use parentheses.

04:00.040 --> 04:04.910
Event name in between and then between the quotation marks the code you want to execute.

04:05.020 --> 04:06.580
When this event occurs
