Welcome to this video and you are master you went for the whole course and you learned a lot about Engler.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.910
You should feel confident using its features and building web apps with it.

00:11.910 --> 00:17.520
Now you'll learn about all its core features some advanced features how these features work together

00:17.700 --> 00:21.470
and how you use them in a real application which you don't even deployed.

00:21.780 --> 00:27.150
So these are all the building blocks you need to build amazing web applications with it.

00:27.210 --> 00:32.290
Now of course really learning and mastering a framework means using it.

00:32.460 --> 00:33.420
So use it.

00:33.430 --> 00:38.220
Bolduc sample project pick some web pages you like and try to rebut them.

00:38.220 --> 00:44.250
Maybe an easier version of them with angular dive into the individual features of Angler maybe even

00:44.250 --> 00:46.100
dive in the source code of Angler.

00:46.110 --> 00:52.380
It's open source in the end or have a look at the official documentation to dive deeper into some specific

00:52.380 --> 00:53.810
use cases.

00:53.850 --> 00:57.380
Also there are some advanced courses and tutorials available.

00:57.420 --> 01:03.900
For example I myself do have some courses on me which allow you to dive deeper or use angler in conjunction

01:03.900 --> 01:08.870
with are things like I wanted to do build mobile applications or two Gabr with note.

01:08.900 --> 01:15.840
J.S. as a back end these are all great next steps and whether that's a course by me some other tutorial

01:16.020 --> 01:18.140
or your own example project.

01:18.210 --> 01:23.550
I'd be very interested in seeing what you build what you do so definitely send me a message if you bought

01:23.550 --> 01:26.030
some amazing project or anything like that.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.220
All the best to you.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.700
See you may be an avid courses and simply have a great time
