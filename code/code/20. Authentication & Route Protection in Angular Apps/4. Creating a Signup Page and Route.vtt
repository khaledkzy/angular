00:02.580 --> 00:09.330
That in our application when we need to do to be able to sign users in we first of all need to create

00:09.330 --> 00:11.490
a sign up and sign in page right.

00:11.520 --> 00:16.760
Without that it's going to be pretty hard to store or send any tokens because you won't get them.

00:16.770 --> 00:19.500
So let's start with this and let's create two new components.

00:19.510 --> 00:25.680
A sign up and a sign in page which we can then display to allow the user to do chest death sign in or

00:25.680 --> 00:27.100
sign up.

00:27.120 --> 00:30.570
So here in the terminal I will use the slide to create two new components.

00:30.570 --> 00:34.350
Definitely feel free to pause to view and create them on your own.

00:34.350 --> 00:40.110
I will use the Seelye as just mentioned with ngi GC to create a new component and I want to store all

00:40.110 --> 00:43.590
these authentication related components in all folder.

00:43.710 --> 00:50.120
So actually pass off slash and then the component name as an argument here only a sign up component

00:50.460 --> 00:55.770
and I'll add Spackles false to prevent the creation of this testing file and then I'm going to do the

00:55.770 --> 00:59.140
same for it sign in in the very same folder.

00:59.580 --> 01:04.560
So that should give me a new folder with two components sign up and sign in.

01:04.650 --> 01:09.660
And now it's all about adding something to the components adding some content a form which allows the

01:09.660 --> 01:11.970
user to sign up or sign in.

01:12.060 --> 01:16.540
No I will keep this very very simple since it's not really about forums here.

01:16.590 --> 01:24.060
I will generate a very basic form in which I only want to add a form group using the bootstraps as class

01:24.270 --> 01:30.770
with a label where I expect to get an email because when using firebase authentication you offended

01:30.780 --> 01:32.600
with email and password.

01:32.640 --> 01:42.380
So there are added fields you will need with input type e-mail and a name and an ID of email and a name

01:42.410 --> 01:43.780
of e-mail.

01:44.060 --> 01:49.560
And I'll also add Engy model to it to register this as a control in my template driven form.

01:49.610 --> 01:56.330
So you learned this in the form's module in this course and then I'm going to copy this to also provide

01:56.330 --> 01:57.460
a password field.

01:57.500 --> 02:05.750
Now for this all change that all to password here to type the ID and the name or leave and model on

02:05.750 --> 02:13.110
this and I will add a button where I will simply say sign up an honest but partner I at some bootstrap

02:13.110 --> 02:16.280
Plaza's pattern and pattern primary.

02:16.280 --> 02:21.180
I want to make this pattern of type submit because that should be responsible for submitting the form.

02:21.260 --> 02:28.310
And with that I want to add my energy submit listener here to the overall forum where I will call on

02:28.400 --> 02:30.950
sign up where I need to pass the form.

02:30.950 --> 02:37.160
So let's place a local reference on the old form assign it to NZ form to get access to the underlying

02:37.160 --> 02:42.520
form object angler created for us and pass it to you on sign up.

02:42.530 --> 02:46.820
So here now in the component body I'll add on sign up the Smurfit.

02:46.820 --> 02:50.270
I know that in this method I will receive the form.

02:50.270 --> 02:56.180
Since that is what will pass year we just set this up in a template of type and form which you need

02:56.180 --> 02:58.530
to import from at Angola forums.

02:58.790 --> 03:06.440
And with that here I can now try to you will reach out to firebase and to send that data and sign the

03:06.440 --> 03:07.370
user up.

03:07.460 --> 03:13.190
And now in this map that year I know I can retrieve the email from the form value and then the email

03:13.190 --> 03:15.370
property data to control we added.

03:15.650 --> 03:17.460
And the same or the password.

03:17.570 --> 03:21.160
So that's going to be the data I want to use now.

03:21.230 --> 03:27.500
The one thing which is missing is a way to load the sign up component to see if the form looks all right

03:27.530 --> 03:30.380
and to be able to actually submit it.

03:30.740 --> 03:37.610
Now to be able to load the form I'll go to my app routing module and here I simply want to add new routes

03:37.610 --> 03:43.240
to the app I want to add a route which allows me to handle the sign up path.

03:43.250 --> 03:52.010
So if you want to well sign up in this case I want to load the sign up component so let's quickly reference

03:52.010 --> 03:55.900
it here and make sure to add a word at the top of the file.

03:55.980 --> 04:01.830
It was added to AB module by the seal I automatically dare you of course and to have it.

04:01.830 --> 04:04.640
So that is our sign up component.

04:04.710 --> 04:10.770
Now with that component being in place here and with that route being a place here we should be able

04:10.770 --> 04:19.440
to at least go to our running application and manually wizard slash sign up to see our form looks all

04:19.440 --> 04:20.900
right almost.

04:20.910 --> 04:29.660
We should add a C S S class to our inputs form control to make DS input fields look a little bit nicer.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.410
Because right now they don't.

04:31.980 --> 04:39.120
But we this in place we have a solid sign in form and solid sign up form excuse me a little bit broad

04:39.130 --> 04:48.300
Maybe so we can make this smaller by enclosing it in another row and then setting a let's say call X's

04:48.300 --> 04:56.110
12 to have the full width on small on very small devices call S-M tend to have a bit of a narrower sign

04:56.110 --> 05:03.400
on a sign up for an on less small devices and call MDH you narrowed it down more.

05:03.420 --> 05:05.560
Now you also Center it.

05:05.750 --> 05:15.580
I will also add call as I'm offset one and call M.D offset to these are old bootstrap classes basically

05:15.580 --> 05:23.930
making sure that columns which are displayed on bigger displays which are smaller basically are then

05:23.990 --> 05:26.410
indented so that they are centered.

05:26.680 --> 05:33.280
And with that we got a little bit of a more well narrowed down for them and you can find this to your

05:33.280 --> 05:33.550
needs.

05:33.550 --> 05:37.540
Of course this is the sign up component.

05:37.540 --> 05:42.530
Now I also want to add a link in the header to be able to go there.

05:42.700 --> 05:50.730
So in the head or component if we access it here I actually want to add a new link and I want to add

05:50.730 --> 05:54.430
as you're on the right side of the navigation area.

05:54.430 --> 05:59.690
So I'll add a new list item here and in this list item ongoing to add a anchor tag.

06:00.040 --> 06:07.150
This anchor tag of course will receive the router link directive pointing to the absolute path slash

06:07.150 --> 06:11.450
sign up and I will say register on this link.

06:11.500 --> 06:17.500
Now with that if we go back we see the register link here and correctly loads the sign up page.

06:17.620 --> 06:18.960
So Dadaism plays.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.150
Now let's move onto the next lecture and let's actually enable authentication on our firebase back end

06:25.540 --> 06:30.070
and then learn how we can send the request to the back end to create a new user
