00:02.500 --> 00:08.680
Let's add a log out button so that we are able to leave the app or lock the user out or add a log out

00:08.680 --> 00:10.790
method in my office service.

00:10.870 --> 00:18.250
And here I can then call Firebrace off again and there's simply the sign out method to well let firewalls

00:18.250 --> 00:24.670
clean up the storage bins on what I will do though is I will reset the token in days.

00:24.900 --> 00:31.310
Appier So in terms of service and log out should because from the hetero component of course.

00:31.330 --> 00:36.450
There I want to display another link in the case that we are logged in.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.110
This link here should of course leads to the log out page.

00:41.180 --> 00:48.380
However it will not lead to a route it should simply give us the style of having a cruiser which looks

00:48.380 --> 00:53.580
like a pointer so that we can click it and then have a click listener which will execute on log out.

00:53.630 --> 01:00.190
So I will say log out on the link and Endal on log out method and you have a component here.

01:00.350 --> 01:06.350
Well all I want to do here is I want to exercise my office service and call the log out method.

01:06.350 --> 01:09.130
Now the remaining pieces to only show this link.

01:09.260 --> 01:12.710
If we are offending hated so I will add NGF to it.

01:12.710 --> 01:18.050
Of course you could also use N-G template to wrap that and to drop down an access to you.

01:18.140 --> 01:21.570
All service is authenticated method here too.

01:22.190 --> 01:27.800
And I will quickly just wrap this over multiple lines so that you can see what's going on here.

01:28.280 --> 01:34.600
So with days in place if we now saved us we should have a log out button especially if we changed his

01:34.610 --> 01:37.430
typo fix this year to off service.

01:37.430 --> 01:43.070
Now we should have a log out button as soon as I do log any year.

01:43.070 --> 01:48.760
So with the credentials locked in Fahid log out we go back to the log in state.

01:48.770 --> 01:54.380
Now what I want to do is I want to make sure that the routing is in line with our sign up status.

01:54.420 --> 01:58.090
So we aren't allowed to access new recipe if we are not locked in.

01:58.310 --> 02:04.280
And on the other hand if we do a log in I want to get redirected and not stay on this page.

02:04.290 --> 02:07.410
So these are things I will take care about in the next Electra's
