00:02.560 --> 00:05.470
In the last lecture we created the sign up page.

00:05.490 --> 00:07.830
Now I want to use it and to use it.

00:07.830 --> 00:13.700
We have to go to the firebase back end and we get this authentication area.

00:13.700 --> 00:17.160
Now right now authentication is not enabled in our project.

00:17.340 --> 00:21.360
So we have to set up a sign in method to enable it.

00:21.360 --> 00:24.020
And here you can choose from a couple of different providers.

00:24.180 --> 00:30.150
But for our own authentication like we're building it only the first one may be chosen email and password

00:30.150 --> 00:34.050
authentication click Enable your and then save.

00:34.500 --> 00:40.850
And now you should be able to send create new users or assign users in requests to the backend.

00:41.400 --> 00:49.450
That means that now we can start sending this request in our front end and to send it forward the often

00:49.450 --> 00:54.660
dictation related things I will actually use the firebase SDK.

00:54.690 --> 01:01.420
The reason for this is that there is no great rest API from firebase side for this.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.590
So I will use the SDK.

01:03.600 --> 01:10.580
Of course in your app where you might use a different back end you will probably use the normal HTP

01:10.640 --> 01:16.740
servers we used before like in the data storage service to send the request with the off indication

01:16.740 --> 01:22.290
data and where you will then get this token as part of the response and you will have to store just

01:22.290 --> 01:22.920
token.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.800
For example in local storage manually.

01:25.800 --> 01:35.420
Now to use firebase with the SDK we can simply install the firebase package by running NPM STOL minus

01:35.430 --> 01:37.930
minus save firebase.

01:38.300 --> 01:42.170
This will pull down the latest version it added to our project.

01:42.180 --> 01:50.220
It should also automatically give us some typescript libraries so that we can this directly in our typescript

01:50.220 --> 01:51.210
code.

01:51.510 --> 01:55.760
And with that added We need some kind of extra service don't we.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.640
So I will add a new service in the off file.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.460
I will name it of service.

02:02.460 --> 02:08.760
This should be the service which has the methods we will call for creating users signing users in and

02:08.760 --> 02:09.980
so on.

02:10.500 --> 02:19.340
So here we'll export a clause which will name off service and for now all I want to create here is the

02:19.490 --> 02:28.670
sign up user method I expect to get an email address here which is a string and a password which will

02:28.670 --> 02:30.170
be a string.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.880
This is the method I want to call to sign a user up.

02:34.880 --> 02:42.000
Now as I said we're going to use the firebase SDK and order it to be able to use the firebase SDK.

02:42.170 --> 02:49.050
We need to configure it we should configure it at the point of time our app starts.

02:49.100 --> 02:52.540
So a good place would be in the app component in it.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.190
Hook.

02:53.570 --> 03:04.370
So I'll add the on in that hook here and therefore call N-G on in it here and now I want to import firebase.

03:04.370 --> 03:06.530
Remember we edit the package.

03:06.740 --> 03:09.340
So here I'll add import.

03:09.800 --> 03:15.340
Now I want to import everything from the firebase package under the firebase alias.

03:15.350 --> 03:20.490
So from firebase and now an engine in it I can execute firebase.

03:20.500 --> 03:26.500
And here you can call initialize app initialize epos a method which expects to get a javascript object

03:26.590 --> 03:30.730
as an argument and this object can be retrieved from our back end.

03:30.970 --> 03:35.160
If you click on a web set up here it will retrieve your credentials.

03:35.200 --> 03:40.720
We only need the off domain an API Ickey though as a side note of course I will delete my project after

03:40.720 --> 03:41.910
recording so no need.

03:41.920 --> 03:48.910
And noting my credentials here I will simply add these two key value pairs and with that firebase the

03:48.910 --> 03:54.220
STK should be initialized at the point of time you start your app or it will get initialized.

03:54.220 --> 04:00.150
At this point of time I should say so we're all set to now implement our sign up method.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.320
Let's do this in the next lecture.
