Now with the basic authentication working and of course there are things you can improve.

00:07.130 --> 00:10.830
We had to look at it the way you stored a token and so on.

00:10.860 --> 00:17.980
The thing I want to add to this app is I want to make sure that we only see the managed pattern here

00:17.990 --> 00:22.480
if we are locked in because otherwise we're not allowed to click anything here anyways.

00:22.910 --> 00:30.610
And I also only want to allow access to the new recipe or the added recipe route.

00:30.890 --> 00:34.280
If we are logged into so we will add some route cards for that.

00:34.520 --> 00:40.110
Let's start with the R L and making sure that we only see the items which are interesting to us.

00:41.100 --> 00:47.670
I'll go to the off service and here a one to add a method which allows you to find out whether I'm authenticated

00:47.760 --> 00:49.070
or not.

00:49.320 --> 00:55.340
So what I can do is I can add a new method is authenticated Meffert.

00:55.710 --> 00:58.600
And here I want to return the result of a check.

00:58.740 --> 01:02.730
The check is if the token is not equal to NULL with one equals sign.

01:02.730 --> 01:09.190
So one to find out if the token Well if it is now then that means we are not offending it.

01:09.270 --> 01:16.230
So is authenticated should only return true if the token is not Najla which means it is said it is present.

01:16.680 --> 01:23.250
So if this we can go to the head component and inject hour of service year because it's in the header

01:23.280 --> 01:26.540
where I want to control which links should be displayed.

01:26.730 --> 01:32.930
Now if the officer is injected be an exercise in the HMO code and I will wrap my list items here in

01:32.930 --> 01:39.420
the energy template because I don't want to read them in a day or something like that that would destroy

01:39.420 --> 01:40.370
a lot.

01:40.710 --> 01:44.970
And on this end template I can now find NGF without the start.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.060
So I'm deliberately not using D-Nice or syntax because here I want to wrap multiple elements in one

01:51.060 --> 01:56.850
NGF condition and I want to check of all servers is authentic and it is false.

01:56.850 --> 02:02.210
Which means you are not authentic at it which means I want to display these buttons and on the dropdown

02:02.220 --> 02:04.030
the opposite is the case here.

02:04.050 --> 02:10.380
I only want to display them if you want to display the dropdown is offended it returns through.

02:10.710 --> 02:14.530
Well let's have a look at our application we see register and log in.

02:14.530 --> 02:19.350
And if I do log in this switches to the manager button.

02:19.350 --> 02:23.220
So we are indeed now seeing what we want to see.

02:23.220 --> 02:25.200
So we have a nice application thus far.

02:25.200 --> 02:30.540
The one thing we do have is if we reload we always have to log in again but that's OK for me.

02:30.660 --> 02:34.920
What I want to add though is a log out button which will destroy our token.

02:34.950 --> 02:37.180
So I will do this in the next lecture.
