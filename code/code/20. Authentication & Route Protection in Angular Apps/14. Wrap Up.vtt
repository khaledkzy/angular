00:02.610 --> 00:08.890
So with that we now got a working application we're not able to access routes if we are not signed in.

00:08.910 --> 00:10.580
We're not able to see the links.

00:10.590 --> 00:17.070
If we are not signed and we learned how we can hook this up to firebase though I will repeat this firebase

00:17.070 --> 00:19.580
is only a dummy solution here.

00:19.620 --> 00:26.670
I try to take a very generic approach which is why a stored a token in this token property here as I

00:26.670 --> 00:32.120
assume that when using a different back end you probably will store a token in some way like this.

00:32.160 --> 00:37.560
Of course you may add then a method to retrieve the token at a time to launch the app and check if there

00:37.560 --> 00:39.460
is a token local storage.

00:39.510 --> 00:42.570
These are all ways of improving the app.

00:42.690 --> 00:48.630
I'm happy with the state we reached here and that we are able to use the features angler offers us to

00:48.630 --> 00:54.910
protect this app and to control where the user is allowed to go and where it may not go.
