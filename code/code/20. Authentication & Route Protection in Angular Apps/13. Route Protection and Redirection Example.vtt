00:02.430 --> 00:08.490
Let's fix the routing and our application first of all if we sign in I want to redirect the user.

00:08.610 --> 00:10.040
Oh that's easy to do.

00:10.120 --> 00:16.410
And sign in component we can simply redirect the user here but I only want to redirect if you sign in

00:16.410 --> 00:18.120
was successful let's say.

00:18.370 --> 00:24.600
So I'll actually go to the off service where we have to sign in user method here and here I want to

00:24.660 --> 00:26.580
inject the router.

00:26.880 --> 00:32.040
So in the constructor here I'll inject the angular router of type router.

00:32.160 --> 00:40.940
And to be imported from the Angler or router package of course we need to add an injectable to dis service

00:40.940 --> 00:45.170
to allow the injection of Avars services into it.

00:45.170 --> 00:54.820
And then a year in the response Colbeck of design in user Meffert here we know that we are signed in.

00:55.030 --> 01:02.110
So it's here where I want to redirect the users so to call router navigate and let's say we just go

01:02.110 --> 01:03.800
to the root page.

01:04.240 --> 01:10.440
So let's try this out if we save this and the app reloads we start on the sign in page.

01:10.450 --> 01:14.200
Anyways let's enter valid credentials.

01:14.680 --> 01:15.610
And that looks good.

01:15.620 --> 01:16.940
We are redirect that.

01:17.050 --> 01:18.460
So that's working.

01:18.490 --> 01:27.480
Now I want to make sure that I can't visit the new recipe or edit recipe page if I am not locked in.

01:27.550 --> 01:35.270
So for days we will treat a new guard and I will trade it here and all folder all named off guard.

01:35.530 --> 01:37.060
And technically it's a service.

01:37.060 --> 01:40.880
All the files named off guard service are TS.

01:40.900 --> 01:47.620
I will export my off guard here and it implements can actually wait.

01:47.630 --> 01:51.900
Now you learned about that in the routing section didn't you.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.440
Capital Sido can activate as an interface.

01:56.450 --> 02:03.370
We have to import from an angler router and it requires us to implement can activate Methot.

02:03.500 --> 02:08.660
This method will give us the realit activated route's snapshot.

02:08.660 --> 02:16.940
So a snapshot the route anti-state of the routers so a router is a state snapshot and then we have to

02:16.940 --> 02:22.020
return something there and observable a promise or a boolean value.

02:22.040 --> 02:29.120
Now I will return a boolean value because I plan on injecting the off service year so lets add add injectable

02:29.120 --> 02:30.610
to allow this.

02:30.800 --> 02:37.200
Now in the constructor I want to add my all service as we have done many times before.

02:37.280 --> 02:44.960
Here it is at the import and then I can simply turn the result of all service is authenticated and that

02:45.020 --> 02:45.890
is a boolean.

02:45.890 --> 02:51.530
Remember because data is what we returned down here we simply check if the token is present.

02:51.710 --> 02:59.690
Now with that we got our Can D-Wade card our off guard and now any app routing file a one to apply discard

03:00.010 --> 03:01.390
to this new route.

03:01.430 --> 03:03.430
Anti-ID added route.

03:03.590 --> 03:04.380
So I'll add.

03:04.410 --> 03:07.030
Can't actually wait here.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.670
Remember it's an array of guards and I'll add my.

03:10.670 --> 03:11.790
Off guard.

03:11.810 --> 03:19.410
Make sure to add to import here from your all folder and I'm going to copy this town down to the recipe

03:19.500 --> 03:21.220
added guard.

03:21.360 --> 03:26.250
Now with that I also have to provide it in the app module.

03:26.310 --> 03:31.080
So here I'll provide my off guard like this.

03:31.080 --> 03:38.400
Now of course we all need to make sure that we add the import here from the folder with all this added.

03:38.430 --> 03:40.150
Let's see if this works.

03:40.200 --> 03:45.750
I'm not defending Kate right now because the AB reloaded in effect the new recipe I can click it as

03:45.750 --> 03:46.730
often as I want.

03:46.860 --> 03:51.720
No chance I can load the detail but trying to edit it.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.580
No chance.

03:53.790 --> 03:56.560
Now I can delete it but this is only on the front.

03:56.560 --> 04:01.410
And of course you could also try preventing this from happening though you wouldn't use a guard for

04:01.410 --> 04:03.790
this because that's not a route we're calling there.

04:03.870 --> 04:10.170
So the off guard is in place and of course it could redirect in case of a failure in off guard or something

04:10.170 --> 04:12.430
like dead whatever you like.
