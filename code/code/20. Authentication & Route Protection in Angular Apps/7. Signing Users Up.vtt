00:02.740 --> 00:08.790
In the last lecture we configured firebase and enabled authentication Lets now allow the user to sign

00:08.790 --> 00:13.630
up for this off service where we already have to sign up user method.

00:13.890 --> 00:21.690
I will import everything as firebase from firebase again just like in the app component and therefore

00:21.690 --> 00:28.260
with the SDK I will now call off which is a method which will give us access to all the office related

00:28.260 --> 00:29.190
methods.

00:29.400 --> 00:35.970
So chained to this return or to the result of this method call we can call create user with email and

00:35.970 --> 00:42.290
password which I guess is a pretty descriptive method and tells you what it does here.

00:42.360 --> 00:48.960
We need to pass an email and password and this will do just that will create a new user with email and

00:48.960 --> 00:50.160
password.

00:50.170 --> 00:56.130
Now this is a promise so you can listen to the response in the then block but I'm only interested in

00:56.130 --> 01:02.160
any potential errors which I don't want to print to the console so I will use that as 6 arrow function

01:02.160 --> 01:08.640
here and simply log any errors we might get so that we as a developer can see what's going wrong.

01:08.640 --> 01:13.810
Of course you could improve things and implement some proper error handling where you display some error

01:13.810 --> 01:15.030
or to the user.

01:15.510 --> 01:18.210
So if there's And she surfs still running.

01:18.220 --> 01:19.420
We're almost there.

01:19.440 --> 01:25.300
However we need to call Sign-Up user whenever we click the sign up button in our component.

01:25.770 --> 01:27.520
Well nothing easier than that.

01:27.540 --> 01:31.290
We get the on site Meffert we get our office service.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.030
All we need to do is provide the service.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.600
I'll do this in the app module.

01:36.690 --> 01:43.540
So all services providers here and now and the sign up component where we have to on sign up Meffert

01:43.960 --> 01:48.580
I will inject my of service like this.

01:48.640 --> 01:54.940
Make sure to add to import at the top of course just like you had to import it in a module as a side

01:54.940 --> 01:55.500
note.

01:55.540 --> 02:02.640
So does import here should be added to and now and set up component in on sign up with the off service

02:02.700 --> 02:09.120
inject that we can centrally or simply reach out to add to the OR SERVICE sign up user pass our email

02:09.120 --> 02:10.020
and password.

02:10.260 --> 02:19.850
And I'd say let's hit the submit button and see what happens in the application when it is reloads let's

02:19.850 --> 02:28.890
fill out these data with some test data like that hit submit and I don't see anything which probably

02:28.890 --> 02:36.630
is a good sign because we only catch errors if we have a look at the of education tab here and refresh

02:36.630 --> 02:42.670
it you indeed see a new user was created so that is working.

02:42.690 --> 02:48.930
Now one thing to note though firebase requires you to have a password which is at least six characters

02:48.930 --> 02:49.540
long.

02:49.620 --> 02:56.070
So if I tried to enter a four digit password I get back an error which correctly says the password should

02:56.070 --> 02:57.910
be at least six characters.

02:57.960 --> 03:03.940
So of course feel free to add some validation to the form to enforce a minimum length of six characters.

03:04.080 --> 03:08.760
You can check out the form section that's caused to learn more about the built in validators which might

03:08.760 --> 03:14.580
be helpful regarding this important piece for me or is that validation is working if we can create new

03:14.580 --> 03:15.400
users.

03:15.450 --> 03:20.500
Next let's add the sign in page and allow users to sign in once they were created.
