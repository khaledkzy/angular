<p>You can of course improve this app even more. Some ideas:</p><ul><li>Check if a token is present at application startup (check the localStorage manually or use the Firebase SDK to do so - just make sure that you somehow wait for the SDK to finish its initialization)</li><li>Redirect the user if he want to access a protected route (right now, nothing happens) - inject the router and call this.router.navigate(...) to do so</li><li>Redirect the user on logout so that he's not able to stay on pages which are reserved for authenticated users - you can simply inject the router and call this.router.navigate(...) in the logout() method</li></ul><p><br></p>
