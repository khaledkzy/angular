00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.540
So we're almost done.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.560
But the delete button isn't entirely working as expected.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.960
It's updating the list but we're staying on the page of the deleted recipe so to change this we need

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.400
to go to the recipe detail component which again is where did the lead recipe button layups and and

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.680
on each recipe we simply need to navigate away.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:35.770
We already get the router and check it here so we can simply call this router navigate.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.740
And now I simply want to navigate to slash recipes here.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.490
And with that we should have the right user experience that once does updates your dad.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.100
If I clicked delete your it just deleted and we were taken back to the main view.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:05.450
So let's try this a final time you're with spaghetti searching for a fitting image for spaghetti.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.010
Let's pick this one here.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.980
And let's enjoy it here.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.270
And let's finally enter a description tasty spaghetti.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.610
Let's have an ingredient to add some spaghetti 10 let's say and let's save the form.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.970
And this all works.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.580
But one thing is not working.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.680
Do you see which the image we're not getting a preview of the image here.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.200
So let's fix this in the next lecture before we finally move on.
