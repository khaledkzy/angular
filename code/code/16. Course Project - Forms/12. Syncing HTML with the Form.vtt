00:02.570 --> 00:04.370
So we created our form.

00:04.440 --> 00:09.140
Let's now synchronize a to age female code for this.

00:09.140 --> 00:11.300
First of all that's very important.

00:11.300 --> 00:15.620
We need to add something to the app module in the important array.

00:15.620 --> 00:24.170
We now not only need deforms Marchal will also need the reactive forms module which needs to be imported

00:24.260 --> 00:29.840
from at angler foreigns overwise synchronizing with our age.

00:29.890 --> 00:35.720
Similar code will fail because we don't have access to the directives we need for that.

00:35.780 --> 00:43.890
So therefore what I'll do is go to my recipe edit component HMO file and now I want to connect my form.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.870
Let's start on the overall form element here.

00:47.900 --> 00:55.670
We have the form group directive which we should use with square brackets because we need to pass some

00:55.670 --> 00:57.290
data to that directive.

00:57.320 --> 01:01.920
Why are property binding and that data is our recipe form.

01:01.940 --> 01:09.190
So let's quickly assign this now Bertelli angler's that our overall form is managed by us.

01:09.230 --> 01:11.630
And that anger itself should not manage it.

01:11.630 --> 01:14.030
Instead it should take our form.

01:14.480 --> 01:19.440
With this we can now assign our own controls.

01:19.440 --> 01:26.910
So let's simply go to it first and put the name here and there we have the form control name directive.

01:27.110 --> 01:33.230
Now we could enclose it in square brackets and then use single quotation marks but we need double quotation

01:33.230 --> 01:41.480
marks or we omit both ends of the justis syntax and note a name here of course has to match the name.

01:41.570 --> 01:42.830
We set up here.

01:42.980 --> 01:44.600
So here we chose a name.

01:44.690 --> 01:49.930
We should choose the same N-th our code now will copy this.

01:50.070 --> 01:56.060
Also for the image you are here I chose image path as a name.

01:56.100 --> 01:58.480
So let's make sure to use this.

01:58.890 --> 02:03.810
And of course description for our text area here here.

02:03.870 --> 02:12.060
I also will add the form group name directive and assign description now to be able to see something.

02:12.080 --> 02:17.450
I'll also set up DNG submit listener and listen to on submit.

02:17.450 --> 02:21.130
Now here of course I don't need to pass the form as an argument.

02:21.170 --> 02:26.280
Instead I can simply add d on submit Meffert here.

02:26.510 --> 02:31.170
And for now simply log my recipe for to the console.

02:31.190 --> 02:34.250
Let's see if everything works as it should.

02:34.490 --> 02:42.760
So once this has recompiled I'll head over to the forum and this looks OK.

02:42.850 --> 02:46.010
It almost works as expected.

02:46.060 --> 02:52.670
The name was pre-populated for de-selected recipe and it does update.

02:52.690 --> 02:58.830
If we change this to big Fatburger the description is not displayed though.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.790
So that is not how I want it to behave.

03:02.970 --> 03:09.420
As a side note on a new recipe it correctly sets this to an empty form so that is OK but would be nice

03:09.420 --> 03:11.660
if the description is displayed too.

03:11.940 --> 03:18.320
If I submit the form but have a look at the value description.

03:18.380 --> 03:21.530
Actually it says what else you need to say.

03:21.530 --> 03:23.940
So what could be wrong about the description then.

03:24.750 --> 03:28.650
Well if we have a look at the text area I simply assigned the wrong directive.

03:28.650 --> 03:32.550
It should be a form control name with the same place if it reloads.

03:32.610 --> 03:34.420
Does looks much better.

03:34.920 --> 03:39.150
So with that de-centralized sation is working.

03:39.150 --> 03:46.440
The next step is to get our ingredients to work correctly and that actually will involve a couple of

03:46.440 --> 03:50.160
steps because we need to manage just array of ingredients for that
