The blog we recognize the last lecture is a pretty mean one.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:15.590
If we add a new recipe here we save and we go to a shopping list and go back.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.790
You see it's lost it's gone again.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.760
Test test and gone.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.320
So what's happening here.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:34.510
The issue we encounter here is that we provide our recipes service and the recipes component.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.520
So all the components in this area share the same instance.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.650
But if we navigate away to the shopping list area the recipes component is destroyed and so is the instance

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.640
of this service.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:57.010
So what we need to do to ensure that our service survives is we need to add it to our app Marchal here

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:07.840
by adding it to your recipes service recipe service and adding to import to we make sure that now we

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.530
have one instance of the service all the time available.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.800
As long as our app is running.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:22.360
So now if we add the spaghetti one more time with our beautiful image very tasty as mentioned before

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.430
and I hit save.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.850
Now if I come back it's still there.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.270
And as you can see I can still edit it.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.290
So this is now working.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.020
Now we can try putting it to the shopping list which of course doesn't add.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.040
We first of all have to add some ingredients like spaghetti.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.550
But now this is working as expected.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.820
Well almost.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.150
With the remaining bug that here once we clicked does X button we're not deleting the ingredient.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.970
So that's something we should all have a look at.
