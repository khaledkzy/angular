00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.670
So let's reset the forum once you click Update or add.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.000
Definitely go ahead and try it on your own time to pause the video now before I will show you how I

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.920
would do that.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.930
So where are you successful.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.670
There is something tricky about that but let's start with the straightforward part.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.870
After we saved our updated value or safety update about your new value I should say we can of course

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.600
call form reset here.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:41.160
Now if I do this let's see if it works as expected if I type bread to year 10 and it clicks and it resets

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.690
so this works.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.100
If I just select tomatoes and change just to Brett it updates it to read.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.070
But now we're stuck in the update mode.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.980
If I add red again maybe 12 it still updates the old one right.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.860
It doesn't add a new one because we never leave the edit mode.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.910
The reason for this of course is that initially we are in EDID mode set to False.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.390
Then we switch to true whenever we get DS started editing observable to fire.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.150
But we never switch it back.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.450
While we should switch it back and actually we only need to switch it back here in on an item here I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.150
can simply called this edit mode and set it to false.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.210
No matter what it was before.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.190
This ensures that we definitely leave it because we are done.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.560
Also we could rename this on an item to simply say on submit because on an item is not correct all the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.580
times but that is not important data.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.750
Just a little cosmetic change.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.540
Rename it in the template then though.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:59.480
So if this emplace if we now try this again let's add a new item that works let's added an existing

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:10.450
one bananas to and now let's try adding schnitzel 1.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.020
Now you see that seems to work again.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.260
Now we can correctly update Rube's tomatoes our items here.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.050
And it switches between EDID mode and update mode.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.440
Of course I also need to make sure that the delete and clear button works.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.660
So let's work on the clear button next
