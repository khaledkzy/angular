00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:09.060
So we added the resetting and the clear mechanism let's make sure we can delete the items for this of

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.080
course and even our listener here and definitely try solving this on your own if you want.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.740
So that's your chance to pause the video

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.400
if you don't want to solve it on your own or if you are already finished with it now.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.230
Well we can definitely go ahead and do it together.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.930
So I'm calling on the lead here.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.720
When it clicked the delete button and I'll add this method to my shopping edit component.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.470
Well in on THE LEAD What do we need to do here.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.020
We need to inform the service that it should remove one of the items in the raid that is basically almost

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:53.360
all we all need to make sure that we call this on clear because we definitely also want to clear a form

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.660
if we delete the item which was loaded.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:04.380
Now in a shopping list service I need to add a Meffert delete ingredient and I expect to get indexed

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.060
where I should delete it with that information I can simply use my ingredients array and splice one

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.250
of the elements splice allows us to start at a specific point for example at index year and then splice

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.810
one element thus removing it.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.320
And then of course as always we should call ingredients change and of course you could read fact or

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.880
it is in its own method.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.990
But I think that's OK I like this too.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.510
So here I will slice or simply pass a copy of my ingredients and with that the final step is before

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:47.030
we clear everything I will reach out to my shopping list servers call delete ingredient and simply pass

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.320
the added item index as a value.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.510
Now this will throw an error or if it clicked delete without loading an item.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.840
So therefore I will simply add NGF to the bottom and I'll just restructure to make it easier to read

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.440
Engy if to only display the button.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.260
If we are in added mode so no I don't default we don't see delete fate switch to an item.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.210
I Kansi and I click it it resets the form and delete the id..

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.170
Now no more items are left of course.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.760
I can still add new ones and delete them again so that is our shopping list for them.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.940
Working with the template driven approach and a lot of other nice features like the service really showing

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.310
you how you could set up something like this.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.910
How you can use set value how you can reset the form and therefore hopefully both the form you need

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.930
now in the next lecture.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.660
I will move on to the recipe edit form which you will create using the re-active approach
