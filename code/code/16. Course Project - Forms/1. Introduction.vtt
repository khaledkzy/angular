00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.890
Welcome back to our recipe book Corsair.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.470
We already added a lot of features to it.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.660
Now I went to add forums.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.550
We have two places where we need to add forms when we create a new recipe or edit the recipe in the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.710
recipe editor component and the shopping list here.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.950
We already are able to add elements to the shopping list but we can handle this in a better way through

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.620
a forum and then I also want to make these buttons here work.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.720
The forum for the recipe as soon as we can create new ones.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.280
I also want to make that delete button work.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.690
Let's start with the shopping list for him in the next lectures here.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.100
I want to use a template driven approach and certainly feel free to go ahead and try implementing this

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.090
on your own.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.700
But there are a couple of different approaches of implementing it so probably we won't have the same

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.650
solution in the next lecture.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.510
We'll start together and I will show you my approach
