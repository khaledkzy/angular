In the last lectures we did a lot of set up to get the information about the item we're about to edit.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.840
Now let's edit it.

00:11.530 --> 00:18.610
I want to get the item we want to edit it for this in a shop and a service only a new method which is

00:18.610 --> 00:28.000
simply get ingredient which expects to get the index number and which will simply return as the ingredient

00:28.000 --> 00:29.630
from our ingredients array.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.650
So the ingredient add is index.

00:32.650 --> 00:39.820
So with that returned we now can reach out cutis new method in our shopping added component and store

00:39.820 --> 00:48.250
it in the edited item maybe which is an ingredient of type ingredient and we do this whenever we get

00:48.430 --> 00:51.420
new information that we're in the edit mode.

00:51.430 --> 00:58.540
I should say so here edited item will be said equal to you reaching out to the shopping service to the

00:58.540 --> 01:01.260
item we get from the get ingredient method.

01:01.330 --> 01:04.750
And here we simply pass our index.

01:04.780 --> 01:07.600
So with this we get a lot of information here.

01:07.750 --> 01:11.360
Now we need to update our form if we are in edit mode.

01:11.800 --> 01:16.180
And four days I want to get access to the form now on the form.

01:16.180 --> 01:23.970
We do have a local reference if we can use this together with the child to get access to it.

01:23.980 --> 01:32.020
So here I will actually use at view child and make sure to add to the import from an English core I

01:32.020 --> 01:41.310
will reach out to AF and this will be the shopping list for him of Taieb Angie for him.

01:41.340 --> 01:43.880
So make sure to assign this type here.

01:44.070 --> 01:49.560
Now once we get all the new information inside of the SUBSCRIBE Colback and that is of course important

01:49.770 --> 01:51.070
outside of there.

01:51.090 --> 01:53.000
This will not be run.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.130
Each time we get new information but it might be run before we got any information at all.

01:58.350 --> 02:02.030
So outside would be wrong inside of this call back here.

02:02.070 --> 02:07.450
I want to reach out to my forum and call set the value here.

02:07.710 --> 02:17.640
And now I want to assign a new value for a name I will use my edited item and your name and for amount

02:17.880 --> 02:23.550
you guessed it I'll also use my end of that item and then the amount and this should make sure that

02:23.550 --> 02:29.900
whenever we select a new item we actually populate the form with the right values.

02:29.940 --> 02:36.800
We can already try this with any server running once our page reloads.

02:36.850 --> 02:41.550
If I click here we indeed select the correct item.

02:41.590 --> 02:44.000
So dad is working as expected.

02:44.170 --> 02:50.950
Of course it still adds it as a new item so we need to make sure that if we are editing we correctly

02:50.950 --> 02:57.160
rename the bottom to to update or something like this and that we then also do update the item and don't

02:57.190 --> 02:58.020
add a new one.

02:58.060 --> 02:59.980
Let's do this in the next lecture
