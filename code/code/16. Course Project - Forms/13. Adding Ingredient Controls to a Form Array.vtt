00:02.250 --> 00:04.880
So let's work on our ingredients list.

00:04.960 --> 00:10.230
The base form is working but of course we got a novel control which we haven't added yet.

00:10.450 --> 00:13.740
Does this array of ingredients.

00:13.790 --> 00:22.470
So when we initialize the form we actually will have one other default value for the recipe ingredients.

00:22.490 --> 00:33.210
This will be a new form array and you should import form array from an angler foreigns this form array

00:33.210 --> 00:36.780
is initialized with a default value of an empty array.

00:36.780 --> 00:40.930
Because we don't have any ingredients by default.

00:40.990 --> 00:47.300
Now with this if that is our default What do we override to here in edit mode.

00:48.510 --> 00:54.570
Well there we will simply need to check if we have any ingredients to begin with because theoretically

00:54.630 --> 00:58.690
you could create a recipe without ingredients.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.970
So here what I want us.

01:01.140 --> 01:09.230
I want to check if my recipe which I load loaded if it does have ingredients.

01:09.330 --> 01:16.220
So if that is defined I know I can safely use them.

01:16.240 --> 01:24.570
So in this case I want to use all the ingredients so I can simply root through them with a form of loop.

01:24.600 --> 01:29.410
So for a single ingredient of my

01:31.770 --> 01:40.390
ingredients I can go through all of them and I can push them onto my recipe ingredients for aere which

01:40.390 --> 01:43.070
has a push method here.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.740
I don't push the ingredient.

01:45.130 --> 01:53.650
I push a new form group instead because I do have two controls which will control a single ingredient

01:54.010 --> 01:55.540
the name and the amount.

01:55.780 --> 02:03.370
So these will be grouped in a form group and here I will have a name which is now a new form control

02:03.940 --> 02:13.570
with a default value of ingredient name and I will have an amount control on the new form control which

02:13.570 --> 02:18.400
has the default value ingredient amount but not name amount.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.050
So data is a form group.

02:20.060 --> 02:25.150
I will push onto this array because again we have two controls here.

02:25.180 --> 02:27.530
Validation will follow later.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.760
And with that we get a default value for recipe ingredients.

02:30.760 --> 02:40.420
If we have a recipe and if this recipe then has ingredients with Dad we can assign the ingredients control

02:40.420 --> 02:46.840
down there and it simply is our recipe ingredients which already is this new form eraser.

02:47.580 --> 02:49.370
So that's looking all right.

02:49.650 --> 02:55.670
Let's see if it works and for that of course we need to synchronize our array with our age team all

02:55.680 --> 02:56.470
code.

02:56.670 --> 03:02.870
So any recipe added component if we scroll down to that section where we want to use the array of first

03:02.910 --> 03:08.130
work on the day which wraps the whole section we're going to use here.

03:08.160 --> 03:12.900
I need to add the form array name directive days.

03:13.020 --> 03:19.390
Then be bound to ingredients because ingredients keep in mind is the name of our format right here.

03:19.620 --> 03:25.350
So that assigns that in this area we're going to handle this array of controls.

03:25.350 --> 03:29.970
Now each control of course is now going to be our row here.

03:30.420 --> 03:39.600
So on this row I can place the form group name directive referring to the individual form group name

03:39.630 --> 03:48.750
because remember in our array we will have four groups as each pair of name and amount control creates

03:48.750 --> 03:50.550
a form group.

03:50.550 --> 03:52.230
Now what's the name of the forum group.

03:52.260 --> 03:55.890
Though we didn't assign it because it's part of the array.

03:56.430 --> 03:59.460
Well we learned how to get this name.

03:59.460 --> 04:06.950
We need to add energy forward to this death and then we can loop through all the ingredients through

04:06.960 --> 04:10.000
all the controls I should say in our array.

04:10.380 --> 04:21.890
So I can loop through the Ingredion control of my recipe for him and there get the ingredients control

04:22.010 --> 04:27.850
get as a method which gives us access to that and here all the controls of this control.

04:27.890 --> 04:32.930
So this gives us access to all the controls and the individual control is now saved in the Ingredion

04:32.930 --> 04:42.320
control property or variable we can use that template and can you extract the index of the current iteration

04:42.650 --> 04:45.470
which will be the name for my form group.

04:45.620 --> 04:52.720
So if property binding I can now blind I here this should give me the form group.

04:52.730 --> 04:59.090
Now we also need to populate these inputs and there it's very easy because now we're inside the form

04:59.090 --> 05:02.950
group and there we have names we have name and amount.

05:03.140 --> 05:09.620
So here we can again use form control name status equal to name for the first control and form control

05:09.620 --> 05:13.640
name equal to amount for the second one.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.600
Let's see if that works as expected.

05:16.820 --> 05:18.710
Well it already looks pretty good to me.

05:18.710 --> 05:24.820
Here we got buns and meat and if we added the schnitzel we got meat and french fries.

05:24.860 --> 05:26.960
So that gets populated correctly.

05:26.970 --> 05:31.280
Does is working as intended with that we got our aere added.

05:31.370 --> 05:37.030
Now of course we also need to add a way for us to dynamically add new items to dead
