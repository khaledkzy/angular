00:02.470 --> 00:06.490
So in the last section we create DHT Moloko for our form.

00:06.490 --> 00:12.310
Now let's initialize our forum and we will use the reactive approach as I already said.

00:12.340 --> 00:18.280
Now for this approach it's important to understand if we are in edit mode or new mode and we do get

00:18.340 --> 00:21.480
this information here why is that important.

00:21.790 --> 00:28.360
Well of course because depending on this we need to repopulate the fields or not.

00:28.780 --> 00:36.430
So I will create a new private method in the recipe added component which all name in that form because

00:36.430 --> 00:39.980
it is responsible for initializing our form.

00:40.210 --> 00:43.200
The form itself should be a property here.

00:43.270 --> 00:46.880
So I will name a recipe for him and it will be of type form group.

00:46.900 --> 00:55.210
As you learned to be imported from an angler Fornes now we can build this recipe for him here in in

00:55.260 --> 00:56.770
that form.

00:56.920 --> 01:04.300
Basically I will reach out to it and assign a value and this value will be a new form group to give

01:04.300 --> 01:12.720
us the outer shell of our form so to say the frame for group takes a javascript object where we have

01:12.720 --> 01:16.570
key value pairs for decontrol we want to register.

01:16.590 --> 01:24.030
So the first control I do want to register here is the name the name of the recipe.

01:24.120 --> 01:28.760
This will be a new form control so we should import form control from it.

01:28.790 --> 01:32.270
A lot of forms to end here.

01:32.270 --> 01:38.420
Now as I said it's important to decide whether we are in edit mode or not because that will determine

01:38.630 --> 01:42.200
whether we want to assign an initial value or not.

01:42.650 --> 01:49.220
Well we could simply create a variable at the top here which holds our recipe name and let's set it

01:49.220 --> 01:52.760
to an empty string by default.

01:52.860 --> 01:59.870
Then let's add some logic which decides what the value should be if we are in edit mode.

02:00.020 --> 02:03.020
So let's check if there's edit mode.

02:03.320 --> 02:12.500
If that's the case then recipe name should probably be something else and it should probably be the

02:12.500 --> 02:15.490
value of the recipe.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.050
We can load with the idea we got here.

02:18.110 --> 02:26.930
We do have the IDs stored up there so we can simply inject our recipe service.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.240
Let's do it this.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.270
Recipe service.

02:29.270 --> 02:32.970
Make sure to add to import at the top here.

02:34.130 --> 02:37.500
And now we can fetch our recipe here.

02:37.520 --> 02:44.510
The recipe we're currently editing so I will fetch it right at the beginning the recipe reaching out

02:44.510 --> 02:53.230
to the recipe service and then with get recipe and passing the idea of the recipe we know we are editing.

02:53.300 --> 02:59.690
I can get it actually I shouldn't do it here because I would try to get one if we don't have an ID because

02:59.720 --> 03:01.370
we are not in edit mode.

03:01.460 --> 03:03.030
I should do it in here.

03:04.210 --> 03:06.370
So now we got a recipe.

03:06.490 --> 03:12.380
Now we can simply access the name of the recipe and assign this to our variable here.

03:12.520 --> 03:18.610
Now the same will be true for the image your L D recipe image path.

03:18.780 --> 03:24.640
It's an empty string by default and the same is probably true for the description so recipe description

03:24.640 --> 03:28.680
is also an empty string by default and the ingredients.

03:28.690 --> 03:30.670
I'll come back to this.

03:30.760 --> 03:36.360
So for now let's override all these variables if we are in edit mode.

03:36.400 --> 03:44.740
It's a recipe image part will be said to recipe image path and recipe description will be said to recipe

03:44.770 --> 03:46.250
description here.

03:46.750 --> 03:54.460
And with Dad we can simply assign recipe name here for the name as a default value because it will either

03:54.460 --> 04:01.360
be an empty string that's the default or if we happen to be in added mode it will have the name of the

04:01.360 --> 04:05.080
recipe we are editing as a value.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.380
So with that we got the name.

04:07.390 --> 04:10.770
Now it's all assigned the image path here.

04:10.840 --> 04:17.920
Also add a new form control and set this recipe image path as a side note will take care about validation

04:17.920 --> 04:26.350
later and let's assign the description here a new form control again and we should assign the recipe

04:26.350 --> 04:28.130
description.

04:28.210 --> 04:31.660
Now again I'll take care about the ingredients later.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.030
That is our base form created.

04:35.110 --> 04:37.870
Now when should we call in it for him.

04:37.900 --> 04:46.890
This method here we should call it whenever our route Perens change because data indicates that we reloaded

04:46.960 --> 04:48.040
the page.

04:48.040 --> 04:52.160
So that is where we should call this in it for him.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.490
Now that we are creating a format that probably will work.

04:56.620 --> 05:02.010
However now we need to synchronize our form to our AGM code.

05:02.140 --> 05:04.070
We'll do this in the next lecture
