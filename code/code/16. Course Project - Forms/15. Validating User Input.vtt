00:02.450 --> 00:05.500
We finish our form in its basic form.

00:05.540 --> 00:08.400
But time to add some validation to it.

00:08.660 --> 00:11.870
We do it validation of course in our types of code.

00:12.020 --> 00:17.520
Right now there is no validation attached to any of the controls and that is not really the behavior.

00:17.640 --> 00:27.500
And when we initialize the form here at the end of it for him for name for example I want to add a built

00:27.530 --> 00:28.370
in validator.

00:28.370 --> 00:34.370
So from the validators package which we need to import from an Anglo forms.

00:34.490 --> 00:41.150
So from this package I want to add the required validator don't execute it don't add parentheses.

00:41.150 --> 00:47.610
You only want to pass a reference to this validator so that Engler is able to execute this method at

00:47.610 --> 00:50.550
the time it validates the input.

00:50.570 --> 00:54.820
Now the image path that should also be required.

00:54.950 --> 00:57.640
So I'll repeat the procedure here as required.

00:57.680 --> 01:05.840
Don't execute it and don't copy it because it also won't require the description for the ingredients.

01:05.870 --> 01:14.270
When we create a new ingredient here the name should also be required and the amount here I'm going

01:14.270 --> 01:18.980
to add two checks the first one is that it's required.

01:18.980 --> 01:24.560
The second element here actually is the pattern validator.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.180
And here we can copy the pattern we use in the shopping edit component.

01:29.430 --> 01:35.510
This regular expression here is the same expression I want to validate your year that we only have positive

01:35.510 --> 01:44.570
numbers here and pattern you'll simply pass a regular expression by putting two forward slashes and

01:44.600 --> 01:49.480
in-between your expression without any quotation marks here.

01:49.550 --> 01:55.200
So that is the pattern and we do execute this method because this acts like a factory.

01:55.220 --> 02:01.970
It gives us back D configured validator then which will be used by angler but to configure it we need

02:01.970 --> 02:03.170
to pass an argument right.

02:03.170 --> 02:11.210
We need to tell that what should be our pattern so that ARDE validators for a new form control in the

02:11.210 --> 02:15.220
array for you amount control I should say.

02:15.500 --> 02:23.290
Let's also copy that to the on ADD ingredient Meffert or we also create a new form array form group.

02:23.360 --> 02:29.060
So here I will set the default values to now and then also add my validators.

02:29.360 --> 02:33.920
And the same for the name should have an empty default value.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.250
And then you're just required validator.

02:37.730 --> 02:46.240
So now validation should be added to the form successful and to use it I will this able to save button

02:46.520 --> 02:48.460
if the form is not valid.

02:48.740 --> 02:55.180
So I will bind to disabled and check if recipe for form is not valid.

02:56.320 --> 03:00.090
Well let's see if this reloads we should see

03:03.550 --> 03:08.860
that the save button gets disabled I would say but I've got to well at 4 am here.

03:08.870 --> 03:11.280
So let's empty the name and it's disabled.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.490
That looks good.

03:12.740 --> 03:20.660
Let's now empty that description disabled or ill disabled or any control here.

03:20.660 --> 03:29.300
So the name of this ingredient or maybe the number or a negative number so that all seems to work the

03:29.300 --> 03:33.800
validation state is successfully taken into account.

03:33.860 --> 03:41.390
Now to finish the validation I'll go to my C S S sheet and I want to mark invalid inputs.

03:41.780 --> 03:47.550
Now we get this handy Engy invalid class which is added to anything which is invalid.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.260
And that's the problem.

03:49.400 --> 03:53.540
If I add a border of let's say one pixel solid and dread.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.510
Well watch for yourself.

03:55.780 --> 04:01.400
If I remove that not only is the name input field invalid the whole form is.

04:01.430 --> 04:04.250
So the whole form has this ugly border.

04:04.700 --> 04:13.460
Well we can simply change this to assign energy or assign this class this style I should say only two

04:13.460 --> 04:22.840
elements with hefty Engy invalid class but which also are an input or optionally to be very explicit

04:22.840 --> 04:28.460
here a text area in our case here with ngi in ballot so if does.

04:28.470 --> 04:34.620
Now we should make sure that if I remove this only the box itself receives the red border to prevent

04:34.800 --> 04:38.250
this from having the red border right from the start.

04:38.460 --> 04:44.730
I'll also add ngi touched here as a check or as a class which has to be present so that we at least

04:44.730 --> 04:49.090
had to click into that control to market as invalid.

04:49.770 --> 04:52.240
You will see what I mean if I add a new recipe.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.110
Everything is clean.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.970
If I click in here and out of there now it has the red border.

04:58.530 --> 05:01.920
So that is validation of working as it looks to me.

05:01.920 --> 05:08.440
Now let's make sure that we can actually submit a form and save it or is successfully updated.
