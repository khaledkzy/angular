We're almost done fixing bugs.

00:04.700 --> 00:10.270
Our recipe Service is now working as expected if we switch back and forth to spaghetti aren't there.

00:10.610 --> 00:16.760
But now if we go back to recipe editor component does delete button does X year.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.420
It's not working.

00:18.440 --> 00:22.670
First of all it's even submitting our form and we definitely don't want that.

00:22.910 --> 00:25.620
So we should set the type 2 button.

00:26.100 --> 00:34.840
Then also add a click listener and say on delete ingredient and here of course I should pass the information

00:34.840 --> 00:37.270
of which ingredient should get deleted.

00:37.640 --> 00:47.960
So I should pass the index which is simply the index of the control we want to remove with Dad we can

00:48.320 --> 00:54.320
implement the on the lead ingredient method in our typescript file here.

00:54.740 --> 01:00.130
And I know that I will receive the index here number.

01:00.150 --> 01:07.800
Now with that I can get access to my recipe for him to call to get Meffert and get access to my ingredients

01:07.800 --> 01:13.730
which I know is a form erase all let's cast it as we did earlier to.

01:13.900 --> 01:20.530
And now we can call the remove at Mefford and pass the index to remove a specific form control the one

01:20.530 --> 01:23.370
at the position we want to delete.

01:23.410 --> 01:28.680
Now with that in place we can save this.

01:28.920 --> 01:34.700
And now if we open a recipe and edit it and remove this.

01:34.710 --> 01:38.560
Now you see it indeed removes the ingredient.

01:38.760 --> 01:44.340
So now we updated the recipe and therefore we only sent the french fries to the shopping list.

01:44.340 --> 01:50.100
And again the other box we had before is fixed our recipes survive.

01:50.100 --> 01:57.210
Now to clean this up there is one thing I forgot to do earlier in the recipe list component where we

01:57.210 --> 02:00.950
subscribe to our recipes change event here.

02:01.350 --> 02:04.940
Well we should unsubscribe and if the component gets destroyed.

02:05.160 --> 02:12.690
So let's implement on destroy and import this from an angle or core and then I will add energy on the

02:12.690 --> 02:13.860
stroy here.

02:14.710 --> 02:22.060
And I want to store the subscription in a property named subscription of type subscription which needs

02:22.060 --> 02:27.870
to be imported from our ex-chief as subscription.

02:28.090 --> 02:36.070
And then I can store it by signing it as a value here in on in it to subscription is a signed and an

02:36.070 --> 02:45.380
on the stroy that I can now unsubscribe again to make sure I don't cause any memory leaks here.

02:45.390 --> 02:51.330
So with that with all these back fixes we added our app is looking great.

02:51.330 --> 02:53.260
It should work fine now.

02:53.550 --> 02:56.090
We can add new recipes here.

02:56.130 --> 03:04.950
We can edit existing ones we can remove the ingredients there and add new ingredients if we want of

03:04.950 --> 03:09.160
course we can then use them and send them to the shopping list.

03:09.180 --> 03:17.220
They are we can delete them we can add new items or decide our wise and clear to form our forums are

03:17.220 --> 03:24.510
working great here and use quite a lot of useful tools you may use in your next application which are

03:24.510 --> 03:29.090
great to enhance it and to offer a great user experience.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.420
With that let's move on to the next course section
