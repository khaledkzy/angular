00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.100
And The Last Lecture we edit our own recipe spaghetti and we recognize that the image preview is not

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.450
working well that makes sense because if we have a look at the recipe edit component here where we try

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.750
to preview the image we're not finding the source.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.950
We should do what is.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.170
I'll add a local reference named immerged path to that input because I want to get access to that input

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.260
inside of this template.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:40.190
And then all bind the source you're to that local reference to image POV value because that is exactly

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.650
what I want to display here with that if we now create a new recipe and paste in our old link now we

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.620
immediately get a preview of this image.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.280
So now it's working as expected.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.860
And now if I add my spaghetti recipe.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:09.160
Very tasteful with my new ingredient spaghetti 100 and some tomatoes.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.780
Three.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.570
And if I had save now here it is.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.880
Now we can see it.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.400
Now we can edit it.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.490
Multiple exclamation marks make it more meaningful.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.120
We can send it to the shopping list to find our spaghetti on tomatoes there.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.290
Well we already have tomatoes here so we can delete these here I guess.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.580
And we lost it.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.550
Where are our spaghetti is.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.310
If I go back to recipes spaghetti are gone.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.550
So that seems to be another bug we need to fix.
