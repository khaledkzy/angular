00:02.380 --> 00:09.620
So time to make our items editable by clicking them in our shopping list component where we have our

00:09.620 --> 00:16.800
items I want to add a click listener to the item so that we well can click it here.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.230
I want to call on an item.

00:19.230 --> 00:23.690
Of course any name you like simply copy it.

00:23.690 --> 00:29.000
Now here though I also want to get the idea of the ingredient and I need the ideas are there and later

00:29.030 --> 00:34.330
able to replace the correct one in the array of ingredients which is managed in a service.

00:34.670 --> 00:37.210
So let's extract the ID like this.

00:37.220 --> 00:44.670
I equals it next to get the well index of the current iteration and let's pass it here as an argument.

00:45.080 --> 00:49.420
Now I can copy this name and go into my type's code here.

00:49.430 --> 00:56.160
I want to add on added item and I know that I will get the index year which will be a number.

00:56.270 --> 00:59.390
And now there are a couple of ways of getting this information.

00:59.390 --> 01:05.180
This index to the shopping added component which is in the end where I want to get it to because that

01:05.180 --> 01:07.310
is where we are editing.

01:07.460 --> 01:13.260
I will use the service or specifically a subject in that service to which I can listen into shopping

01:13.260 --> 01:14.690
at that component.

01:15.020 --> 01:21.320
So I will add a new subject and shopping lists service and data name started editing.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.150
Sounds like a fitting name.

01:23.150 --> 01:27.530
It'll be a new subject and subject is a generic type.

01:27.530 --> 01:29.510
It will hold a number in the end.

01:29.840 --> 01:36.980
That's all I need to change here with this subject created in on and it's item I can reach out to the

01:36.980 --> 01:44.930
shopping list service which we already inject and then use started editing and emit a new value my index

01:45.170 --> 01:50.460
which will make sure that now we pass on this index.

01:50.520 --> 01:58.310
Q our subject for now is that I can listen to it in some other place that our place is going to be in

01:58.310 --> 02:02.130
the shopping added component here in Engy on in it.

02:02.140 --> 02:05.880
This sounds like a good place to do the listening.

02:05.940 --> 02:14.490
I'm already injecting the shopping service so here I will subscribe to my started editing subject and

02:14.490 --> 02:16.350
of course I should clean up the subscription.

02:16.350 --> 02:25.300
If we destroy this component so I will store it in a property named subscription which is of type subscription

02:25.570 --> 02:31.630
which I should import from our exchange as subscription and or move up.

02:31.630 --> 02:35.590
Both these imports here to the top of the file.

02:35.910 --> 02:42.270
So if dad we got our subscription property as I just said I'm going to store my subscription in this

02:42.330 --> 02:43.340
property.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.360
And now I will implement on the stroy.

02:46.380 --> 02:52.890
Therefore you should import this interface from at Igla core and then all implement energy on destroy

02:53.100 --> 02:55.110
to clean up the subscription.

02:55.290 --> 02:58.500
Just to be sure that you don't create a memory leak.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.630
So that's to clean up work.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.170
But what should happen inside of this.

03:02.550 --> 03:10.500
Well here we know that we will receive the number of the item we're about to edit and as will be triggered

03:10.800 --> 03:15.590
whenever we submit the well started editing information.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.660
We also know something else.

03:17.850 --> 03:21.250
We only get here into this anonymous function.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.190
If you start editing was triggered.

03:23.190 --> 03:24.890
So if we are editing.

03:25.230 --> 03:30.450
So that isn't important information when it comes to what we should do wants to form a submitted should

03:30.450 --> 03:33.570
we create a new item or edit an existing one.

03:33.570 --> 03:39.220
So I want to store the mode we're in here in a property and name it edit mode and by default.

03:39.270 --> 03:41.520
It's false here.

03:41.520 --> 03:46.740
However I will set edit mode to true because we are editing right.

03:47.400 --> 03:51.060
So with this we now get the index and we are editing.

03:51.060 --> 03:56.510
I also want to store the index of the item we're editing so edit it.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.490
Item index could be a property name.

03:59.610 --> 04:04.010
It will be a number in the end and it will get initialized here.

04:04.050 --> 04:09.630
Edited item index will be the index we're getting here as an argument.

04:10.530 --> 04:13.980
So we've got a lot of important information.

04:14.520 --> 04:21.510
Now with that information I want to load the item we're about to edit so that is something I'll do in

04:21.510 --> 04:22.730
the next lecture.
