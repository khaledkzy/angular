00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.970
So let's start working on that shopping list for them.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.940
As I mentioned I want to use the template driven approach.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:15.960
So in the shopping list added component here we already got our form element up you're now in trouble

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.460
already.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.030
Take control over this and already get the forms module added in AB module by default.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.690
We of course will need this too.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.580
So with the form year we now can start working on our form controls.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.890
I will get rid of these local references.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.550
I will no longer use that approach.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.140
I will also get rid of D-Calif listener on the Add button instead.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.310
I want to use Angie's submit to submit the form and then call on add item here.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.680
I also will get access to the form created by Engler and as you learn we can get access by placing a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.480
local reference on the form element.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.590
And now this would give us access to the form element itself but by setting is equal to energy forum

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.570
we get access to this javascript object Engler created behind the scenes and now we can simply pass

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.680
this object to this on an item Meffert.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.290
So that is how we can submit the form but we also should register some controls.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.020
We get a couple of controls here.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.520
Let's start with the first one here on the name control.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.440
I will assign a name so the name attribute of name.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.850
So a lot of names here but of course the name between quotation marks is the name of the property will

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:48.700
later have in this form object a singular created and I will assign ngi model to this input so that

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.830
we register it as a control in our template driven form.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:02.350
Now for the second input the name will be a mound and then I'll also add and model and make sure that

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.330
you imported from forms module.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.890
Otherwise this is not available so we should Dave this control added to our form to and the Add button

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.950
here will submit the form because it's only button of type submit.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.660
The other two buttons are of type button so in on an item in this typescript file now I no longer will

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.510
use my element refs here so I can remove these declarations here.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.510
I can get rid of the view child an element ref import and I can get rid of these two lines where I extract

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.790
the data.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.830
I still want to create a new ingredient but now we will simply get the form here and it will be of any

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.860
forms of this type.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:54.260
Since this is the form we will get the value of the form on the value property.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:03.450
Now we can simply use the value and access name to get the name of the ingredient and value amount to

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.780
get the amount because name and amount wurden names we specified here in our template on these input

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.650
elements.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.480
Well let's see if this works.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:23.490
If it's saved us and we go back to the shopping list and scurf is still running purify at bread one

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:32.220
that looks good works like before but now using the better approach of using the built in tools and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.120
therefore building a better form.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.710
Now we can also take advantage of validation and so on and that is something I will do in the next lecture

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.020
.
