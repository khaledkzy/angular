00:02.350 --> 00:05.710
In the last lecture we added our array.

00:05.720 --> 00:08.530
Now I want you clean up how it looks.

00:08.540 --> 00:16.680
Some styling but mainly I went to add a button which allows us to add a new ingredient to that array.

00:17.300 --> 00:21.770
While to work on the styling all and we really want to do is I want to have some spacing between the

00:21.770 --> 00:22.760
rows.

00:23.160 --> 00:31.790
Well there are a couple of ways of getting this style but I will simply do as I will add an inline style

00:31.880 --> 00:36.750
a normal style no angular style no Angie's style directive.

00:36.920 --> 00:43.610
Normal style where I say margin top and set to 10 pixels maybe.

00:43.940 --> 00:46.710
And with that it looks much better.

00:46.790 --> 00:48.910
So that's all I wanted to do for now.

00:49.810 --> 00:57.970
The more important part is that we're able to add new ingredients and for this I'll simply add a new

00:57.970 --> 01:02.340
button at the end of this array area.

01:02.340 --> 01:10.360
So outside of the def which is responsible for my individual form groups or add a new row with a new

01:10.360 --> 01:11.840
column inside of it.

01:14.090 --> 01:22.550
And here I would simply add a button which says add ingredient which will be of type or which will get

01:22.550 --> 01:26.530
a class of button buttons success maybe.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.390
So now it's it's directly at the bottom.

01:29.440 --> 01:34.810
Maybe let's simply add a horizontal line between rows and that looks pretty good.

01:35.150 --> 01:38.810
So now we get this button let's not also hook it up.

01:38.810 --> 01:42.500
I will add a click listener on ADD ingredient.

01:42.740 --> 01:50.120
And here in this method which I'll add to the typescript file I want to add new control to this array

01:50.120 --> 01:52.190
of form controls.

01:52.190 --> 02:03.500
Now I can simply do this by accessing my recipe form there I can get my ingredients control and I know

02:03.500 --> 02:09.750
that this will be a form array but Angler or typescript to be precise doesn't notice.

02:09.830 --> 02:18.020
So I will explicitly cast it with this cost command here basically by enclosing the type I want to convert

02:18.020 --> 02:24.990
it to between smaller and greater than signs and then enclosing this all in parentheses.

02:25.310 --> 02:31.160
And now the part here between the parentheses is treated like a form of rape because I know that it

02:31.160 --> 02:32.910
indeed is one.

02:32.960 --> 02:40.940
So here I can call push and I want to push a new form group because remember we don't push or control

02:40.940 --> 02:42.630
here we need two inputs.

02:42.650 --> 02:49.850
So a group of inputs and there again I will have a name which is a new form control and I will have

02:49.940 --> 02:57.230
an amount which will be a new form control and we don't need to provide any initial values because I

02:57.230 --> 02:58.600
don't want to have any.

02:58.910 --> 03:05.650
So if I save or so we go back to the application we should indeed see that once this reloads year for

03:05.660 --> 03:08.970
click adding relient we add a new line.

03:09.140 --> 03:14.030
However I also submit the form with each click as you can see here on the right.

03:14.030 --> 03:21.070
This is quickly fix by making sure that this button receives the type button.

03:21.140 --> 03:23.460
And now it shouldn't submit to the form anymore.

03:23.690 --> 03:29.120
So now it just adds ingredients disease or working this is great.

03:29.120 --> 03:35.240
Now before we make this form submersible or we do something up on submission let's make sure that we

03:35.240 --> 03:36.940
add some validation to it.
