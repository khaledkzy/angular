00:02.460 --> 00:05.120
Well there are two things we should definitely do.

00:05.160 --> 00:12.990
Free actually we should enable this delete button and when editing a recipe no matter if creating a

00:12.990 --> 00:15.640
new one or editing an existing one.

00:15.770 --> 00:19.280
We should make the cancel button work on hitting save.

00:19.290 --> 00:20.810
We should navigate away.

00:20.820 --> 00:24.100
Actually that's the same which would happen when hitting cancel.

00:24.420 --> 00:30.870
So that would be a challenge for you again make all three buttons work save and cancel to simply navigate

00:30.870 --> 00:31.760
away.

00:32.190 --> 00:37.260
And then also the delete button to delete our recipe.

00:42.220 --> 00:44.020
Here is my approach.

00:44.360 --> 00:48.930
When I want you do is I want to start with the delete button for this.

00:48.950 --> 00:53.060
I'll start the recipe service and add or delete recipe method.

00:53.190 --> 00:59.450
Ress said the world will get the index of the recipe which should get deleted.

00:59.840 --> 01:08.000
And then here I will then use my recipes array called the splice method and splice the index one element

01:08.000 --> 01:09.170
to remove it.

01:09.170 --> 01:17.080
They are after all called Recipes changed and a made a copy of the updated recipes like this.

01:17.930 --> 01:19.420
That's the first step.

01:20.450 --> 01:27.310
Now I can call delete recipe from the recipe detail a component which is where we have this delete button

01:27.770 --> 01:36.410
by adding a click listener on delete recipe and hirable copy dead and implemented in the typescript

01:36.410 --> 01:45.320
file here on the left recipe and I simply want to reach out to the recipe service call delete recipe

01:45.620 --> 01:47.880
and now we also need the ID here.

01:48.020 --> 01:53.450
So we used it early and of course to have this more complicated way of navigating.

01:53.540 --> 01:56.380
But for deleting now we really needed.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.580
So here we should add this ID as an argument.

02:01.220 --> 02:08.060
So before we Tester's let's also make the cancel and save button work and let them navigate us away.

02:08.300 --> 02:13.510
So the recipe added component which is where we have these buttons here.

02:13.670 --> 02:21.280
We should hook them up to any event listener so cancell we should hook up the other one already is automatically

02:21.280 --> 02:24.910
triggering the submission event when we hit cancel.

02:24.910 --> 02:31.740
I want to execute on cancell and in the recipe edit component typescript file.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.970
You don't need that import any more so we can remove it but the thing I wanted to do is I will add d

02:38.030 --> 02:43.070
on cancell methods and in uncancel.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.580
Well here I simply want to navigate away.

02:46.800 --> 02:53.000
So for that we need the router of type router so let's inject it here.

02:53.010 --> 03:01.550
Make sure to import the router Taieb from at angular router and with that injected and on cancell I

03:01.550 --> 03:08.650
can simply access the router and navigate and a want to go up one level.

03:08.690 --> 03:12.360
If we were editing this will take me back to the detail page.

03:12.620 --> 03:17.440
If I clicked on the new button it will take me back to the recipe's page.

03:17.660 --> 03:25.540
So for this to work we need to tell angular what our current route is and we do already inject the TIR

03:25.660 --> 03:27.040
de-activated route.

03:27.380 --> 03:33.860
So with that we can pass the second parameter relative to this route.

03:34.700 --> 03:37.450
So that what happens if we click the cancel button.

03:37.670 --> 03:41.540
I actually want the same to happen once I submit the form.

03:41.570 --> 03:47.970
So here I will call on cancel even though it sounds wrong but we are done at this point.

03:47.990 --> 03:50.910
We can simply navigate away.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.830
Let's see if that all works perfectly cancel.

03:53.830 --> 03:58.510
We're back to our recipe the same for this one.

03:59.650 --> 04:03.420
And if Why do change something and hit save.

04:03.490 --> 04:09.110
We're all back to the updated recipe and if we create a new one and I had to cancel.

04:09.310 --> 04:13.780
We're back to the place like the recipe state which makes sense and if Antrel something here and click

04:13.780 --> 04:14.430
save.

04:14.560 --> 04:21.530
We're back to the state to sell this is our application working fine here.

04:21.580 --> 04:23.240
All these buttons are working.

04:23.380 --> 04:25.910
Let's see if we can delete this recipe now.

04:26.900 --> 04:34.250
Looks almost OK but we still see it here in the detail view even though we deleted it can demonstrate

04:34.370 --> 04:35.780
again for the schnitzel.

04:35.930 --> 04:39.020
See it it's still here even though we removed it.

04:39.140 --> 04:44.880
So that is something we need to update before we are finally done with this section.
