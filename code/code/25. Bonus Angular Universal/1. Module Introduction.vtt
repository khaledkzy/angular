Welcome to this module and this module will dive into angular universal which is a tool provided by

00:09.820 --> 00:17.410
the angler team basically and strongly built into this Selye which allows you to pre render your angular

00:17.410 --> 00:20.500
application on the fly on the server.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.330
Now why is that interesting.

00:22.660 --> 00:30.010
Here's our recipe book and if we inspect the page source here we see that there actually IS NOT DEAD

00:30.010 --> 00:31.560
much to be found right.

00:31.570 --> 00:38.910
We got a bunch of strip imports some information our head section but then mainly we got nothing.

00:39.070 --> 00:41.520
We got our AB root and that is it.

00:41.530 --> 00:48.790
Now the reason for this is that angular of course is a client side FREYBERG and all our content is rendered

00:48.910 --> 00:54.460
in the browser offered his app has been bootstrapped which is done by Deis script files.

00:54.460 --> 01:00.490
Now there's nothing wrong with that in general but of course the user sees that.

01:00.630 --> 01:08.380
But search engines see that and therefore it might be worth exploring a different way of rendering our

01:08.470 --> 01:15.790
angular EMP and angular a universal is a tool which basically provides a nice bridge from the awesome

01:15.830 --> 01:17.890
as we have with angular in the browser.

01:17.890 --> 01:22.210
This high reactivity to the pre rendering of pages.

01:22.300 --> 01:28.570
So the D.H. team will we get back from the server actually is a pre-rendered snapshot of the page and

01:28.570 --> 01:30.610
once it's Denne runs in the client.

01:30.640 --> 01:34.000
So in the browser it's a single page application again.

01:34.030 --> 01:38.790
So we want to get the best of both worlds and angular a universal can help us with that.
