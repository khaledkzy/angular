Getting started with angular a Universal is pretty simple if you're using the angular Selye which you

00:07.850 --> 00:14.110
should and which you are doing in this course on the Get up page of the angular Selye you can dive into

00:14.110 --> 00:19.490
their official documentation and in their documentation here that's basically a link to that.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.120
Vicki there you'll find some link to stories on the right here.

00:25.270 --> 00:27.920
And then to universal rendering.

00:28.210 --> 00:30.580
That's the article we're interested in.

00:30.580 --> 00:35.610
Here you can learn more about how to enable that universal rendering.

00:35.650 --> 00:41.880
And it's just named universal because your angular app then runs on both the client and the server.

00:42.130 --> 00:46.420
So here you learn how to integrate that into angular Selye project.

00:46.540 --> 00:48.940
And thankfully it's pretty simple.

00:48.940 --> 00:52.090
It all starts by adding additional dependencies.

00:52.210 --> 00:59.440
So we'll go through that and all the steps step by step into a module and just one important note I

00:59.440 --> 01:04.990
will be using visuals to do code in this model simply because I'm recording does at a later point of

01:04.990 --> 01:10.800
time does it was recorded after the rest of the course was recorded and I switched the idea.

01:11.020 --> 01:12.730
Now it's still the same code.

01:12.760 --> 01:14.350
It's still the recipe book.

01:14.380 --> 01:21.180
It's still the same project just an angular six project that's important with a different idea.

01:21.550 --> 01:27.610
And with that let's continue and let's dive into all these steps and enable server side rendering with

01:27.610 --> 01:28.810
angular universal.
