00:02.230 --> 00:05.770
So we edit this angular universal pre rendering.

00:05.770 --> 00:09.360
How would you now deploy this application with that added.

00:09.730 --> 00:15.820
You would basically still deploy a disk folder but now you need to deploy it to a server which is capable

00:15.820 --> 00:17.260
of running a node.

00:17.270 --> 00:24.880
JS server because you're hosting service where you deploy a server jast who needs to execute that server

00:24.880 --> 00:28.210
japes file it needs to run that on the server.

00:28.300 --> 00:34.660
That's really important to understand this file needs to be run on the server and therefore to Yukon's

00:34.660 --> 00:36.490
use AWOS as free anymore.

00:36.490 --> 00:43.230
For example you need some server where you can start that file and run it with such a server though.

00:43.390 --> 00:49.180
You just ship the content of the disk folder to it and then configure it to run the server jazz fall

00:49.450 --> 00:50.470
and you're done.

00:50.470 --> 00:53.600
Does this how you would deploy it still deploy the content of this.

00:53.650 --> 00:57.840
But now to a server which is not a static server but one running no.

00:58.370 --> 01:02.320
That said for angular or universal I hope this is helpful.

01:02.350 --> 01:05.410
You can always dive much deeper into this by the way.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.000
This is a basic introduction.

01:07.010 --> 01:12.180
Does this how it works in a nutshell does is what it does on the fly pre rendering.

01:12.190 --> 01:16.960
Always keep in mind you have a single page application again once it runs on the client.

01:17.140 --> 01:21.970
And if you want to dive deeper you can visit universalised angular.

01:22.060 --> 01:29.490
I O to find fervor resources and to get a page off that project where you can also learn more.

01:29.620 --> 01:34.900
Post questions or open issues to be precise and dive deeper into that.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.770
So with that let's move on.
