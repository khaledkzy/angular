Not only can you listen to the updates in your forum you can also update the form on your own.

00:09.520 --> 00:15.450
Just like in the template driven approach set value and Petchey value are there for you.

00:15.820 --> 00:17.540
I will quickly show it here.

00:17.590 --> 00:24.310
You can of course on your form as a whole cause set value and pass a javascript object which should

00:24.310 --> 00:28.250
now resemble the object structure appear when you create the form.

00:28.270 --> 00:35.410
So where you have your user data which then is an object where you have your user name and set is equal

00:35.410 --> 00:38.580
to Max for example.

00:38.730 --> 00:55.050
Have your email set this equal to max at test dot com have your gender male and of course your hobbies.

00:55.050 --> 00:57.520
Potentially an empty array.

00:59.650 --> 01:07.220
So if we do this we should see that now or for this pre-populated with some values because we immediately

01:07.220 --> 01:11.160
call set value and of course you can also call this up on the click of a button.

01:11.660 --> 01:20.090
And as in the template driven approach you also have Patchi value of course if you only want to update

01:20.330 --> 01:25.420
a part of the form like for example the username switches to Anna.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.560
Now you should see that the user name is changed to Anna.

01:28.610 --> 01:32.220
The rest still it contains the values I set with set value.

01:32.390 --> 01:38.720
So just to bring to your attention Pache value and said value are also available and the same is true

01:39.080 --> 01:40.470
for resetting.

01:40.610 --> 01:46.470
So if you want to reset the form after submitting it we can simply call reset here.

01:46.730 --> 01:48.620
So let's quickly do this.

01:49.790 --> 01:51.140
And hit submit.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.660
Now it's gone.

01:52.730 --> 01:55.130
So this empties our form.

01:55.130 --> 02:02.000
Now with that you should have tools to work with the form to configure it to your needs and to really

02:02.000 --> 02:07.380
build powerful for it's time to practice this in the next assignment.
