00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.680
Before diving in the actual code it's super important to understand that angular actually offers two

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.010
approaches when it comes to handling forums.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.920
It offers the template driven approach which is called like this because there you simply set up your

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:25.090
form in the template in HVM all the code and angular will automatically infer the structure of your

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.140
form will infer it which controls your forms has which inputs and makes it easy for you to get started

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.400
quickly.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.250
It also has a more complex approach the reactive approach.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.150
There you actually defined the structure of the form in typescript coat.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.730
You also set up DHT Moul killed and then you manually connect that which might sound more complicated

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.230
than it is in the end and therefore it gives you greater control over it.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.300
You can find you in every little piece about your form.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.250
Now in this module we're going to have a look at both approaches in the next three years.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.200
I'm going to start with the template driven approach which is fine for a lot of use cases.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.960
Before we dive into the more advanced reactive approach
