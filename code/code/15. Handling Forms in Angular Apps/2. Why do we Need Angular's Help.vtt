00:02.410 --> 00:07.190
So let's take a closer look at how angler works together with foreigns.

00:07.190 --> 00:14.290
Consider this for an SD HD male code of a form which you might use and there is nothing angler's specific

00:14.290 --> 00:15.120
about this code.

00:15.130 --> 00:20.980
It's normal HDMI all code which you would place your HMO documents to maybe display a form like this

00:21.070 --> 00:26.380
with an input for the username and the input for the e-mail address.

00:26.380 --> 00:33.220
Now as mentioned in the last vid you angler's job now is to allow you to retrieve the values the user

00:33.220 --> 00:40.870
entered here and also to check some other things like is the form Bela's did the user enter valid information

00:41.680 --> 00:48.790
and all that of course will happen in Javascript in typescript So on the angularity side of your app

00:48.790 --> 00:50.050
you could say.

00:50.050 --> 00:57.520
So you somehow need to be able to parse the values the user enters and you somehow need some javascript

00:57.610 --> 01:03.800
object representation of your form in your typescript code to work with.

01:03.820 --> 01:06.840
So does object code look something like this.

01:06.850 --> 01:08.810
It is more complex than reality.

01:08.980 --> 01:14.980
But these would be the key features we need for example we need to have the value of the form and there

01:15.040 --> 01:22.100
would be Calvin if we would have key value pairs where the key refers to the name of the input.

01:22.100 --> 01:30.100
Like for example name or email as specified in the HMO code and then it holds the value of the user

01:30.100 --> 01:30.970
entered.

01:30.970 --> 01:36.790
Does that make it super simple for you to work with these values in your typescript code and to do something

01:36.790 --> 01:39.040
with the values the user entered.

01:39.100 --> 01:45.820
It might also be helpful if some meta data was stored like for example if the form is valid and this

01:45.820 --> 01:47.430
would be changed to false.

01:47.440 --> 01:54.670
For example if the email address wouldn't be a valid email address this is what Engler does for you.

01:54.760 --> 02:02.200
It allows you or it gives you actually such a javascript object representation off your form making

02:02.200 --> 02:08.300
it simple for you to retrieve user values and to see the state of the form and you work with it.

02:08.320 --> 02:14.050
Now in the next lectures we're going to take a detailed look and we will understand how exactly it works

02:14.290 --> 02:19.300
how we can configure it what we can do with it how we can reset it and much more
