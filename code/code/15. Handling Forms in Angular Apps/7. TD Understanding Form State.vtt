00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:09.060
In the last lecture we learn how we can submit a form created by angular and how we can access to this

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.900
object.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.510
ENGLER created for us.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.790
Now we had a look at the Value property which stores the input of user in key value pairs.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.440
We see that we all have a lot of our properties and that's pretty cool about this javascript object

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.650
about the form handling by angular.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.050
It allows us to really understand the state of our form.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.850
We can see which controls we registered here on the controls object e-mails the written username and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.690
each control of type form control of course a type made available by angular where each control then

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.640
has a couple of properties mostly the same properties we have on the overall form though.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.650
And therefore let's go back to that overall form.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.010
For example properties like dirty disabled enabled errors.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.610
And most of the properties should be pretty self-explanatory dirty for example is true because we changed

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.490
something about that form.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.880
If I reload the page and submit it now you will see that dirty is false because I didn't type into any

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.440
input so therefore of course Dirty is false.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.190
Disabled would be true if the form was disabled for some reason invalid is false because we haven't

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.840
added any validators.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.340
So it isn't invalid.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.620
It is indeed valid.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.710
You do have the valid property down here too.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.590
So the form is valid right now.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.050
We will later learn how to add validators to make sure that a valid email address has to be entered

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.300
for example.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.260
And we also have touched for example to see did we click into some of the fields the difference to Dirty

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.950
would be that for 30 we have to change the field have to change the value of a field for tach we simply

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.350
have to click into it and now it would be touched and you will later learn how these properties can

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.470
be helpful in.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.450
Well changing the user experience for example disabling the submit button if the form is not valid.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.330
I will come back to this later.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.940
It's important to understand that you have all these properties and definitely feel free to dive into

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.240
the output we locked here and understand which properties you have how they change which properties

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.310
the individual controls have and so on.
