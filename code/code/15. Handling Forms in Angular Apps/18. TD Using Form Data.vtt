00:03.200 --> 00:04.470
Now we're almost done.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.570
Let's finish up our form here.

00:06.830 --> 00:10.000
We get a submit button and right now we only log it.

00:10.010 --> 00:18.650
Now let's add something to our little form year let's add a horizontal line below it and let's summarize

00:18.710 --> 00:20.900
our data maybe in.

00:20.960 --> 00:24.340
Well maybe in a new bootstrap row.

00:24.350 --> 00:28.640
So let's add a row class and then a Cullom class.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.330
Here are a very simple one.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.650
Let's summarize our data there.

00:33.680 --> 00:40.780
Place the horizontal line between the bootstrap rows and I want to say or output my username here I

00:40.780 --> 00:44.840
want to output my mail address.

00:45.040 --> 00:56.100
Maybe my secret question and my answer to that question as well as my gender is just a nice summary.

00:56.380 --> 01:03.160
I only want to output this once to form has been submitted and then populated with the data of my well

01:03.160 --> 01:04.650
submitted form.

01:04.660 --> 01:12.550
So in the ad app component here I could add a new property named user maybe which is a javascript object

01:12.790 --> 01:15.350
which holds a user name property.

01:15.610 --> 01:21.550
Let's set it to an empty string by default an email property and these names here of course don't have

01:21.550 --> 01:27.550
to match the control names in your form that's a brand new javascript object not related to your form

01:28.180 --> 01:29.710
directly at least.

01:29.890 --> 01:37.300
Then here we might all have a secret question which is a string and then we have the answer which is

01:37.300 --> 01:40.360
a string and finally the gender which is a string.

01:40.420 --> 01:42.950
So that's my user object as created by default.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.150
And when submitting the form I want to update it.

01:46.330 --> 01:54.710
So here Adem the one to say this user and there I want to access the username let's say and set as equal

01:54.710 --> 02:00.980
to my sign up for them access the value of this form and there we know we have a user name input field

02:01.070 --> 02:03.660
like this and replicate this.

02:03.680 --> 02:11.540
Now as for the e-mail and of course value of course was available on the user data grouping though.

02:11.570 --> 02:17.290
So user name and email was in the user data Maula group kept us in line so we have to access this model

02:17.300 --> 02:22.190
group property first before we can XTi final user name and email.

02:22.190 --> 02:27.190
However the secret question here was available like this.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.480
We did name decontrol

02:31.950 --> 02:38.850
secret though so make sure to use secret when accessing it in the form value.

02:38.930 --> 02:40.610
And the answer.

02:40.890 --> 02:45.910
Well let's see which name we gave this we gave it the name question answer.

02:45.930 --> 02:48.730
So let's use this when accessing the form.

02:48.780 --> 02:55.100
And finally we want to set the user gender equal to what we store and you sign up for them here.

02:55.110 --> 02:57.340
We did name this control gender too.

02:57.390 --> 03:00.040
You can check it down their gender.

03:00.420 --> 03:05.080
So with that we now update all that information in our user.

03:05.190 --> 03:08.710
Maybe we also want to track whether we did submit the forms.

03:08.710 --> 03:16.320
We do have a submitted property set to false initially and we said is too true here because well guess

03:16.320 --> 03:18.300
what we submitted the form.

03:18.450 --> 03:26.280
And with that we could place NGF on our row here to check wherever the form was submitted and only if

03:26.280 --> 03:27.120
it was submitted.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.610
I want to display this block and here.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.080
I don't want to put user user name.

03:34.320 --> 03:39.820
And of course all the other information we gathered like user e-mail here.

03:39.870 --> 03:46.380
So let's quickly add all of this here to a question What be your first.

03:46.410 --> 03:55.650
And then we store a user secret question here we have the answer and so on.

03:55.650 --> 03:58.770
Of course structure does in whatever way you want to structured.

03:58.770 --> 04:03.240
I just want to show you how you can access your values and use them.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.840
And we have this all in place.

04:04.890 --> 04:07.300
Now you don't see that section by default.

04:07.530 --> 04:13.800
But if I enter something here like Anna or let's adjust the user name actually my e-mail address my

04:13.800 --> 04:20.050
first pet which is Nelli and then the gender I think that surprises you.

04:20.080 --> 04:21.540
That's not correct though.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.860
So let's hit submit.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.420
And now we see the data here at the bottom.

04:25.530 --> 04:31.530
This is how you can extract the data how you can use it how you can add a property like submit a to

04:31.530 --> 04:37.020
make sure you only display certain sections of the form was submitted and how you in the end used that

04:37.020 --> 04:37.830
data.

04:37.830 --> 04:42.010
One more thing before we move on to react to forums though.
