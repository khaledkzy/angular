In the last lecture we created our form here in typescript.

00:05.930 --> 00:12.110
The issue is it's nice to have it here but our actual form you could say layoffs in the aged female

00:12.110 --> 00:13.150
template.

00:13.310 --> 00:20.450
So we somehow need to synchronize our aged female inputs and our own form or this form in general with

00:20.450 --> 00:21.550
our own forum.

00:21.680 --> 00:28.580
Right now Engler doesn't know which of our typescript controlled here relates to which input in our

00:28.580 --> 00:34.610
template code it actually doesn't even know that our forum SIGN UP FOR ME YOUR should be attached to

00:34.610 --> 00:35.780
this form.

00:35.960 --> 00:41.900
Right now the one thing it is doing is it is auto detecting that this is a form and it creates a form

00:41.900 --> 00:42.820
for us.

00:42.830 --> 00:44.700
Now we don't want to do that.

00:44.960 --> 00:52.250
So we have to add some directives to override to Stiefel behavior to give angular different instructions

00:52.550 --> 00:54.100
for these directives to work.

00:54.140 --> 01:00.640
You definitely need to make sure that you add the import to reactive forms module in your app module.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.970
Otherwise you will get errors.

01:03.350 --> 01:10.970
Now the first directive we need to add is here on the form itself why are property binding the form

01:11.180 --> 01:13.500
group directive.

01:13.520 --> 01:17.690
Now this simply tells angular hey please take my form group.

01:17.750 --> 01:18.990
Don't infer one.

01:19.010 --> 01:21.050
Don't create a form for me.

01:21.050 --> 01:27.950
Use my form group and we need to set up property binding here because we need to pass our form as an

01:27.950 --> 01:29.530
argument to the directive.

01:29.720 --> 01:36.530
So here we should reference our sign up for the property we created here which stores our form.

01:36.800 --> 01:43.370
We're passing this why are property binding to the form group and now this form is actually synchronized

01:43.370 --> 01:50.360
with the form be created in typescript but we still need to tell angular which controls should be connected

01:50.360 --> 01:52.630
to which inputs and the template code.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.860
For days we get a number directive on this input here.

01:56.870 --> 02:05.500
For example the username we add the form control name directive to tail Engler.

02:05.540 --> 02:09.030
Hey what's the name of this input in my form.

02:09.050 --> 02:10.500
In my typescript form.

02:10.820 --> 02:16.520
Well the name is username this name here because that's the control I want to connect to does input.

02:16.910 --> 02:19.390
So I simply pass username here.

02:19.430 --> 02:24.830
If you're wondering why I'm not using property binding I'm passing a string here.

02:24.830 --> 02:30.800
So if you want to use property 1 you can do this by wrapping this in square brackets and then in closing

02:30.830 --> 02:32.940
username and single quotation marks.

02:32.960 --> 02:38.540
Otherwise it would search for a property named username but this is overly complicated.

02:38.540 --> 02:43.620
If you just want to pass a string simply omit the square brackets and you're good to go.

02:43.970 --> 02:49.910
So if this were taling angler Hey my form should be connected to my to the form stored in the sign up

02:49.910 --> 02:51.030
for that property.

02:51.410 --> 02:57.440
And in this form does input here should be connected to the control with the name username.

02:57.440 --> 03:04.920
Well now I can simply repeat this for the email here the name was email the name we set up here.

03:04.940 --> 03:06.910
Now this control is connected.

03:07.490 --> 03:09.530
And for the gender of course.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.130
So does input here.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.910
I will blindest to gender.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.850
Now if this is let's save this so that it compiles.

03:18.050 --> 03:20.140
And now let's have a look at it.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.400
We don't see any arrows which looks good.

03:22.610 --> 03:27.980
We see that mail is pre-select that looks promising because that was the default value we said when

03:27.980 --> 03:33.690
we created the control and typescript and if we now switch to femal only one of the two is selected.

03:33.860 --> 03:40.490
We also see that if we get select email here that the angular classes are attached untouched pristine

03:40.490 --> 03:41.680
valid and so on.

03:41.900 --> 03:49.910
So it indeed looks like our inputs and HTL are correctly synchronized to our floor and we create a typescript.

03:49.910 --> 03:51.580
So this was successful.

03:51.620 --> 03:55.980
The next step was to actually submit the form to see how this works.
