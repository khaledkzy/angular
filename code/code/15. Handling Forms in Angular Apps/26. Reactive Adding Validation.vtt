00:04.090 --> 00:06.570
Knouted were able to submit a form.

00:06.760 --> 00:11.680
Let's actually add some validation to it and a template driven approach.

00:11.680 --> 00:17.020
We would simply add required year for example to make this field required.

00:17.230 --> 00:18.540
It doesn't work like this.

00:18.550 --> 00:25.120
In the reactive approach because keep in mind and that's key you're not configuring the form in the

00:25.120 --> 00:31.090
template you're only synchronizing it with the directives form control name and for that group but you're

00:31.090 --> 00:36.130
not configuring it here the type of code that's where you configure it.

00:36.130 --> 00:39.230
That is why foreign control takes more than one argument.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.960
There's constructor here.

00:41.020 --> 00:43.630
You cannot only set the default value.

00:43.630 --> 00:50.680
The second argument allows you to specify some validators so you can either only pass a one validator

00:50.680 --> 00:57.160
here like for user name where I only want to make sure that it is required and you do this by adding

00:57.430 --> 00:59.980
the validators object.

00:59.980 --> 01:05.560
Make sure to import it from every angle of forms and there you get a couple of built in validators you

01:05.560 --> 01:08.220
can use for example required.

01:08.440 --> 01:15.070
Now make sure to not call it to not execute it so don't have parentheses after it because you don't

01:15.070 --> 01:17.000
want to execute this method.

01:17.020 --> 01:20.460
It is a static method made available by validators here.

01:20.530 --> 01:24.240
Instead you only want to pass the reference to this method.

01:25.260 --> 01:31.850
Angular will execute the method whenever it detects that the input of this form control changed.

01:32.010 --> 01:38.390
So it just needs to have a reference on what it should execute at this point of time.

01:38.430 --> 01:41.620
So this is the required validator.

01:41.790 --> 01:44.040
But as I said this is only one option.

01:44.040 --> 01:49.200
You can also add multiple validators by simply passing an array of validators.

01:49.200 --> 01:56.300
So year to email I'm going to pass an array of validators because I want to have the required validator.

01:56.310 --> 02:06.150
Just like on the username but I'll add another validator to your I'll add the email validator and this

02:06.170 --> 02:08.640
again all doesn't need to get executed.

02:08.690 --> 02:10.990
We just need to reference.

02:11.090 --> 02:19.070
So here I now also passed my validator and now we do have validation in place.

02:19.370 --> 02:26.960
If we go back to our form and we inspect and let it reload and we inspect the email field here for example

02:27.120 --> 02:28.340
it's invalid.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.800
If I enter something year it's still invalid.

02:32.030 --> 02:37.850
If I enter the email address though it becomes valid when the same of course for username it's invalid

02:37.850 --> 02:38.580
right now.

02:38.690 --> 02:43.030
As soon as I enter something it becomes well that because it's now not empty anymore.

02:43.350 --> 02:48.610
So daises how you can add validation to this approach.
