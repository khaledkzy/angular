00:02.430 --> 00:04.560
So we set everything up and The Last Lecture.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.430
Now let's create our form.

00:06.510 --> 00:13.720
Now we could initializers right here to set a value immediately but I don't like to do this year.

00:13.740 --> 00:19.320
I want to have it in a method because it actually is quite a lot of code and it's not the best place

00:19.320 --> 00:19.900
to have to write.

00:19.910 --> 00:23.130
You are at the top in the property declaration area.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.880
So I will use the on in a lifecycle look for this.

00:25.890 --> 00:27.850
So we'll import on in it.

00:27.900 --> 00:34.110
Make sure to imported from an angle or cohort and therefore I'm required to implement energy on that

00:34.110 --> 00:34.890
method.

00:34.890 --> 00:37.860
And then here I will initialize my form.

00:37.950 --> 00:43.820
You should initialize it before rendering the template of course so make sure to use a lifecycle hook

00:44.010 --> 00:46.790
which is called before the template is rendered.

00:47.030 --> 00:52.010
Hearable set up my sign up formula that said equal to to what.

00:52.320 --> 00:59.790
Well keep in mind sign up form is of type form group so we need to create a new form group here just

00:59.790 --> 01:00.810
like this.

01:00.810 --> 01:07.830
Now we have almost a valid form we need to pass a javascript object here and we're theoretically done.

01:07.830 --> 01:15.360
This is our first created for this javascript object configures it and as it's empty it simply says

01:15.380 --> 01:16.930
or touts angler.

01:17.070 --> 01:24.270
This forum doesn't have any controls so let's add some controls are basically just key value pairs in

01:24.270 --> 01:27.870
this object we pass to the overall form group.

01:27.930 --> 01:30.200
So let's have a look at our HMO code.

01:30.360 --> 01:36.350
We have a user name field and the email field and then we get the radio buttons here at the bottom.

01:36.420 --> 01:41.010
So it would make sense to have a user name control.

01:41.070 --> 01:47.430
I'm wrapping this in quotation marks to make sure that during minification when this code gets some

01:47.430 --> 01:53.200
mangled this property name is kept because I will reference it in th HTML code.

01:53.220 --> 01:55.610
This might not be necessary.

01:55.650 --> 02:01.800
It might not get destroyed but just to be sure I'm wrapping it as a string.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.970
So here what is this now.

02:04.260 --> 02:10.510
Well this is a form control and numbered class made available by the re-active forms module or by the

02:10.560 --> 02:11.460
forms package here.

02:11.480 --> 02:18.300
I should say so I will set up or create a new form control here and form control should also be added

02:18.300 --> 02:22.170
from the forms package from an angle or forms.

02:22.200 --> 02:26.810
Now Tudor's form control constructor we can pass a couple of arguments.

02:26.880 --> 02:32.580
The first argument is to initial state the initial value of this control you could say.

02:32.670 --> 02:37.890
The second argument will be a single validator or an array of validators we want to apply to this control

02:37.950 --> 02:38.630
or come back.

02:38.640 --> 02:43.890
This deferred argument will be potential asynchronous validators.

02:43.890 --> 02:45.910
I will also come back to this later.

02:46.080 --> 02:51.750
For now I want to set an initial state of NULL to have an empty field but you could also pass a string

02:51.930 --> 02:53.770
like default username.

02:53.790 --> 02:56.970
And now this would later be displayed as a DiVall username again.

02:57.090 --> 02:59.920
I'll keep it at null for now.

02:59.940 --> 03:04.070
Now have a look at the template again the next Philos. to email.

03:04.080 --> 03:10.080
So I'm going to add a number control and a number of key value pair in this javascript object which

03:10.080 --> 03:13.050
will also be a new form control.

03:13.050 --> 03:18.840
And here I will also say the default value of NULL again validation will be added later.

03:18.880 --> 03:24.790
Now gender does the gender the user selects is also a new form control.

03:24.840 --> 03:28.350
It might be a radio button but that is just a normal input in the end.

03:28.350 --> 03:31.910
So to annular it simply is a control.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.640
And here I could set this to now.

03:34.650 --> 03:37.690
But I want to select the default gender.

03:37.890 --> 03:41.550
So here I will actually select male because that's my gender.

03:41.550 --> 03:48.600
Feel free to pig female of course or add more genders to desirÃ© of chanters up here to begin with with

03:48.600 --> 03:50.720
this a basic form is initialized.

03:50.730 --> 03:54.700
It has three controls and that is all for now.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.700
This is our first basic form now in the next lecture.

03:58.770 --> 04:03.280
We're going to connect this form be created here in typescript to reform.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.010
We have set up in the age HTML code
