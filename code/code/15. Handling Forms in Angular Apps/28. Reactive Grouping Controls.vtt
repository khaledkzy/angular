00:02.360 --> 00:05.660
In the last lecture I was already mentioning that.

00:05.710 --> 00:09.140
Get all the takes the payoff to element.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.930
What that I mean with that.

00:11.380 --> 00:12.630
It's very simple.

00:12.940 --> 00:21.130
You can specify a payoff here because you might have a nested form let's say user name and email should

00:21.130 --> 00:22.900
be inside a form group.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.170
We use such forms in the template driven approach too.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.850
So here we could create a form group named user data.

00:30.010 --> 00:37.630
And now this is a new form group again form group is not only there to be used on the overall form that

00:37.630 --> 00:44.100
just happens to be a foreign group too but you can still have form groups in the form groups.

00:44.140 --> 00:50.730
So here we could have a form group which of course like the outer form group for the overall form also

00:50.740 --> 00:52.800
takes a javascript object.

00:53.140 --> 00:59.320
And now we can add our form controls inside of this group.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.400
So now we have a nested form.

01:02.560 --> 01:08.350
We need to reflectors and our aged hemol template because right now if we have a look at our form it

01:08.350 --> 01:09.330
will break.

01:09.340 --> 01:11.550
You'll see this in the console.

01:12.070 --> 01:19.960
We get an error because correctly it cannot find a control with the name user name because on the overall

01:19.960 --> 01:22.200
form there is no such control.

01:22.210 --> 01:25.190
It's nested in the User Data form group.

01:25.180 --> 01:34.420
So first of all we need to update our synchronization and we easily do this by wrapping our form controls

01:34.420 --> 01:38.040
here in another element like a div for example.

01:38.260 --> 01:43.330
So the email and user name would be the two controls we can wrap in there to replicate the structure

01:43.330 --> 01:45.230
we have and the types object.

01:45.580 --> 01:50.670
And on this Dith we placed the form group name directive.

01:50.830 --> 01:59.800
So you kind of could see the schema here foreign control name to tail angular which property in our

01:59.990 --> 02:06.250
types of object representing the form relates to which input and form group name to tell it the same

02:06.250 --> 02:07.930
for a form group.

02:07.930 --> 02:11.730
So depending on whether you have new form group or new form control here.

02:12.040 --> 02:17.020
So here to form group name is user data with a capital D.

02:17.020 --> 02:21.130
And now with this tiny edition I don't need to change anything else.

02:21.130 --> 02:24.980
It's almost working again but we still get those error.

02:24.980 --> 02:30.740
Here are different areas but still related to the topic that valid cannot be read on now.

02:30.880 --> 02:37.190
Well that makes sense because get user names still fails because what are we trying to do here.

02:37.240 --> 02:45.250
We try to get a volume control with the name user name on our sign up for an we don't have this year.

02:45.410 --> 02:48.690
We have a nested user data but that's not the same.

02:49.010 --> 02:55.820
So we need to Apptd get to point the part or to contain the pop to that username and that would be user

02:55.820 --> 02:59.810
data dot username and it's as simple as this.

02:59.840 --> 03:03.170
You structure your POV separated with dots.

03:03.350 --> 03:07.060
So if you have a new object just place a dot in between.

03:07.370 --> 03:14.060
So that's pasted everywhere where we used one of these nested controls for email as well.

03:14.060 --> 03:21.050
Therefore And if we now save this it should update and not display any errors any more.

03:21.110 --> 03:28.460
Instead we should see the behavior we saw before with the messages we get if we enter invalid Tator

03:28.670 --> 03:33.310
because now the form is working again taking into account form groups.

03:33.350 --> 03:36.530
So nesting inside of our For now.

03:36.680 --> 03:40.940
And as you saw it was really easy to reflect this in our age HTML code.

03:40.940 --> 03:43.440
It's all about keeping that in sync.

03:43.460 --> 03:44.150
In the end
