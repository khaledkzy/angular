00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.240
So here I am on a simple example form just to get started.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.850
The code responsible for it is does HMO code in the template of my app component here.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.620
And you can find this code attached to this lecture here.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.230
Now it's a simple form.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.380
We're going to expand that or and haunted with some features for our this module to get started.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.090
This is just fine.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.200
Now we have a look at this HMO code.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.370
You will quickly realize that on the foreign tackier I don't have the action attribute pointing to some

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.070
route.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.740
I'm also not specifying the method attribute which typically would be post.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.160
The reason for this is that this forum should not get submitted to a server.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.770
I don't want a HPB request to be the result of me clicking the submit button instead.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.260
As mentioned earlier angler's should handle this form and therefore I don't have an action on it.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.820
This of course means that right now if I had to submit button nothing happens.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.640
If you have a look at the refresh icon up there you see it's not spinning nothing happens because we're

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640
not actually sending a request.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.910
Well we will work on this but first let's understand what actually happens behind the scenes and how

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.450
angular infers such forums create such a javascript object for us as it does when using the template

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.250
driven approach.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.460
Let's understand how we get angular to create this form object for us
