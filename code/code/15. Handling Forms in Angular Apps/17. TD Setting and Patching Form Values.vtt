We learn a lot about the template of the approach before concluding the first part of the module that

00:09.540 --> 00:12.570
will look at the suggested username button here.

00:12.650 --> 00:20.530
It doesn't work but I add it does suggest user name method here where I create a default username.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.780
Now be nice to add up on clicking this button.

00:23.780 --> 00:30.290
We populate this username input here with this user name.

00:30.290 --> 00:35.540
Now you could think about some solutions using two way data binding and they would probably work.

00:35.540 --> 00:42.440
You could 2:8 data point is to User Name property which you don't change with this method.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.550
I just want to show you a different approach.

00:45.560 --> 00:48.500
Remember that we do have access to this forum here.

00:48.530 --> 00:58.130
Frue view child of course it would be nice if we could set the value of one of our inputs and turns

00:58.130 --> 00:59.720
out we can.

00:59.720 --> 01:03.090
For this we get two different methods we can use.

01:03.320 --> 01:08.910
The first one would be on our sign up for them.

01:11.390 --> 01:15.110
Set a value property method here.

01:15.110 --> 01:18.120
This allows you to set the value of the whole form.

01:18.200 --> 01:23.260
And here we need to pass a javascript object exactly representing our form.

01:23.570 --> 01:32.870
So we would need to use or set up user data which is object to where we have let's check a user name

01:33.200 --> 01:38.630
field user name said Judy suggested name here.

01:38.990 --> 01:52.010
And then also e-mail said to mail maybe an empty string and Secret Service to pad maybe and question

01:52.070 --> 01:53.810
or answer.

01:53.810 --> 01:57.850
Keep in mind this is this text area here.

01:57.890 --> 02:01.530
So question are set to an empty string.

02:01.760 --> 02:09.910
And last but not least the gender said two male and with this all that.

02:09.930 --> 02:16.320
Let's go to our template and hook up this button this button here which is of type button so that it

02:16.320 --> 02:19.830
doesn't submit the form and you're allowed a click listener.

02:19.830 --> 02:22.730
And Target does suggest user username Mefford.

02:23.040 --> 02:28.430
So if there's now recompiles and we hit this button you'll see super user was entered here.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.900
However this approach does have one downside.

02:32.070 --> 02:38.760
If we already had some value we enter there and then want to collect such as the user name it well overrides

02:38.790 --> 02:40.580
all our other content.

02:40.590 --> 02:43.380
So this is not necessarily the best approach.

02:43.380 --> 02:51.090
However it does show you how you can set the values of all controls with one convenient command with

02:51.090 --> 02:57.240
the set value command where you pass an exact copy off the form of the form value.

02:57.240 --> 03:02.610
I should say as a Chavez group object and can override the value of each control.

03:02.610 --> 03:07.370
Now as mentioned does this not the best approach so it's commented out.

03:07.770 --> 03:14.850
The better approach here would be to access the sign up form and now actually the form object on it

03:14.880 --> 03:22.990
because sign up for this overall ngi form object is kind of the container of your form you could say.

03:23.190 --> 03:25.910
And there you also have the patch value method.

03:25.950 --> 03:32.280
So this is not available on the sign up form itself but on the form group wrapped inside of it.

03:32.280 --> 03:39.670
And here you can pass javascript Optik to where you only override specific certain controls.

03:39.780 --> 03:42.770
So here you could also pass user data.

03:43.060 --> 03:46.850
Well let me restructure does so it's easier to read user data.

03:48.200 --> 03:56.180
And then inside of user data here you might want to override the user name set up to the chest name

03:56.420 --> 03:59.110
but don't overwrite any other value.

03:59.300 --> 04:05.810
So a decent place if I now save this and I already have an e-mail address entered and something here

04:05.840 --> 04:08.020
and here and X like this button.

04:08.180 --> 04:13.280
Now it only added super user and left all my controls untouched.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.780
So set value and patch value.

04:15.800 --> 04:21.770
Important patch value only available on the form wrapped by ngi form itself.

04:21.890 --> 04:24.840
As a side note set value would be available here too.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.510
So these two commands are very helpful.

04:27.590 --> 04:35.530
Set value to set your whole form pach value to override parts of the form.

04:35.660 --> 04:37.630
Very useful helper methods.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.700
I wanted to bring to your attention.
