Thus far have you learned a lot about the template of the approach and how we can create great forums

00:06.860 --> 00:08.000
with it.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.130
Now let's move on let's leave the world of validating user input here.

00:12.500 --> 00:19.160
And let's say we want to find some default values should which should be displayed for example on the

00:19.160 --> 00:20.320
dropdown here.

00:20.450 --> 00:22.370
Right now it's empty by default.

00:22.430 --> 00:23.430
Well would be nice.

00:23.450 --> 00:26.250
One of the two questions would be selected right.

00:26.420 --> 00:30.430
For days we can change the way we add and Jumala.

00:30.440 --> 00:36.210
Right now we added like this without property or event binding node two way data binding.

00:36.560 --> 00:43.490
Well we can use it together with property bindings so let's add some square brackets around that no

00:43.490 --> 00:47.250
parentheses so that we're not using two way by binding as of now.

00:47.540 --> 00:51.460
And now we can bind it SUPERVALU and memor with it.

00:51.470 --> 00:58.460
I mean the control this inport here which is turned into a control by angler in the background.

00:58.730 --> 01:05.930
So this select your can now be bound to a default value and you could even have a hard code a string

01:05.930 --> 01:06.560
into there.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.650
Don't forget the single quotation marks in this case.

01:09.650 --> 01:13.490
Or are you set up a property like let's say default.

01:13.550 --> 01:17.900
Question Which would be Pat Pat.

01:17.900 --> 01:24.010
Because that is one of the two valid values the other one being teacher for this question here.

01:24.260 --> 01:30.970
So now we can bind us to default question and if we now save this and let it reload you'll see that.

01:30.970 --> 01:33.300
Now Pat is selected.

01:33.440 --> 01:40.160
And of course if we switched just to teacher Well it shouldn't be a surprise that the Alber value is

01:40.160 --> 01:41.040
selected.

01:41.150 --> 01:44.060
So now all of a sudden we're using a default value.

01:44.420 --> 01:49.290
And of course this does not only work for the dropdown It would also work for a user name.

01:49.370 --> 01:55.340
You could point to a default string there pre populating this field with a default username.

01:55.340 --> 02:00.980
Very useful and something you should definitely keep in mind that you are not limited to using energy

02:00.980 --> 02:02.880
more than without any bindings.

02:02.960 --> 02:07.880
You can use one way binding property binding to set a default value.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.370
Of course this value can still be overwritten.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.250
You can still pick a different option here.
