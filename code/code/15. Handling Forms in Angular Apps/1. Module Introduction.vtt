Welcome to this course marshal this course module is about forums so forums on your team our page and

00:10.050 --> 00:12.930
how Engler can help you with those forms.

00:13.120 --> 00:19.500
Now on first sight it might be strange why you would need that help right because a form is something

00:19.500 --> 00:25.260
you can simply submit to the server but then keep in mind you're creating a single page application.

00:25.260 --> 00:28.230
So there is no submitting to the server.

00:28.230 --> 00:31.750
Instead you will need to handle the form through angular.

00:31.860 --> 00:39.000
And if you don't want to submit something to the server you will need to reach out via angler's HDB

00:39.060 --> 00:42.510
service which will cover later in the course to that server.

00:42.690 --> 00:48.090
So you will need to handle your forms through angular and actually angular will help you handling it

00:48.330 --> 00:53.070
because not only will it allow you to get the values the user entered.

00:53.070 --> 00:56.430
It will also allow you to check if a form is valid.

00:56.550 --> 01:01.470
It will allow you to conditionally change the way before mis displayed.

01:01.470 --> 01:08.040
Put some red borders around in valid controls so angular really ships with some powerful tools when

01:08.040 --> 01:09.840
it comes to working with forms.

01:10.020 --> 01:13.980
Let's take a closer look and let's understand what exactly.

01:14.020 --> 01:17.100
Angler does for you how it handles forms
