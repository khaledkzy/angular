00:02.490 --> 00:04.980
We're almost done with this section.

00:05.130 --> 00:11.130
We worked a lot with Reactive the forms now and in the last lecture at the end of it with the asynchronous

00:11.130 --> 00:18.600
validator you saw that the status of this input switch from invalid to pending to ballot for example

00:19.560 --> 00:22.580
there actually is a form state you can track.

00:22.620 --> 00:28.360
In general I'll do this here an engine in it on my sign up for him.

00:28.410 --> 00:36.600
And on each control of this form so on get any control to you have to observables you can listen to

00:37.470 --> 00:39.080
status changes.

00:39.930 --> 00:41.700
And value changes.

00:42.150 --> 00:44.430
So let's listen to value changes.

00:44.730 --> 00:48.090
As mentioned is not searchable so we can subscribe to it.

00:48.570 --> 00:53.520
And as the first argument we passed it called Egg which is executed when new data arrives so this will

00:53.520 --> 00:59.550
be the value because we're listening to value changes that we can lock the value here.

00:59.550 --> 01:07.580
So if we do this have a look at our form if I type something here you see with every keystroke.

01:07.790 --> 01:14.330
The object here is print that the value of the form actually does make sense because the value change

01:14.330 --> 01:17.000
is fired whenever we change something about the form.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.350
So whenever we type into any input.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.320
So this is value changes.

01:21.320 --> 01:27.460
And again you can also call this on the individual forum control and vote copy doesn't and commented

01:27.500 --> 01:32.590
out because we also have status changes.

01:32.870 --> 01:34.980
So here we received a status.

01:34.980 --> 01:38.860
Now let's view this here.

01:39.080 --> 01:44.110
If I type something you see invalid because the form is invalid.

01:44.540 --> 01:50.130
If I type something in here where we have the asynchronous validator you'll see it switch to pending.

01:50.180 --> 01:59.330
And then after 1 enough seconds to Valot So the status changes and value changes to nice hooks observables

01:59.480 --> 02:05.000
you can listen to or you can subscribe to if you really want to closely watch what happens in your forum

02:05.060 --> 02:09.410
or again on individual control and want to react to that.
