00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.070
In the last lectures of this module we learned a lot about angular forms and how we can create such

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.060
a form and configure it to our needs.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.170
But remember there were two approaches not just one.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.580
So we had a look at the template driven approach.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.580
Now we're going to have a look at the reactive approach.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.940
This approach allows you to configure your form in greater detail.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:31.050
You create the form programmatically in typescript and while this might sound more complicated it actually

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.810
isn't that difficult and it might be what you need for your new project.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.940
So let's dive into this approach now.
