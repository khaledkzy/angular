Sometimes you not only want to pre-populated D-Fla. the user entered but you also want to instantly

00:09.500 --> 00:11.490
react to any changes.

00:11.600 --> 00:16.670
Right now everything about this for me your only updates once I click submit.

00:16.730 --> 00:20.240
Then I get this form object where I can retrieve the value.

00:20.270 --> 00:26.470
We don't use two way binding Engy model is ever used without any binding or with one way binding.

00:26.600 --> 00:33.130
But sometimes you instantly want to check something or simply repeat whatever the user entered.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.390
Let's show an example for this question here.

00:37.400 --> 00:43.330
I'm going to add a new form group which style here below the dropdown.

00:43.520 --> 00:48.360
I want to have a text area let's say to introduce a new input.

00:48.380 --> 00:49.720
Let's name it.

00:49.790 --> 00:57.290
Question or answer don't need the idea here don't need columns.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.800
I want to have three rows let's say.

00:59.940 --> 01:02.720
And I'll also distribute this over multiple lines.

01:02.850 --> 01:08.550
And now we could add Engy model to get access to whatever the user entered as a reply.

01:09.060 --> 01:18.400
But maybe for some reason we instantly want to repeat this reply so belowdecks we could say your reply.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.920
And now we want to output the answer to the question.

01:23.490 --> 01:31.290
Well for this we could still use two way binding on and you model your and bind it to the answer property

01:31.290 --> 01:32.270
here.

01:32.310 --> 01:35.840
Of course we need to actually use this onze or property then there.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.490
An answer could be an empty string by default.

01:38.880 --> 01:45.900
With this in place let me also add SEUS as class to the text area form control to give it some nice

01:45.900 --> 01:47.080
styling.

01:47.550 --> 01:55.920
If this reloads we see our text area here and if I enter valid data here for my first pet let's say

01:56.880 --> 02:03.150
a rabbit named Nellie you instantly see that your so you can still use today binding.

02:03.150 --> 02:11.610
And actually if I submit the whole form and open up the developer tools you'll see in the value object.

02:11.790 --> 02:14.960
This is still part of this value object.

02:14.970 --> 02:17.690
It just is updated with every keystroke.

02:17.760 --> 02:24.030
But of course if we submit it we will get a snapshot of the value at a point of time we hit submit.

02:24.090 --> 02:26.760
So two way binding is still possible.

02:26.820 --> 02:33.750
You can still use energy model with two way binding and with that you saw all three forms no binding

02:33.750 --> 02:37.170
to just tell angular data input is a control.

02:37.320 --> 02:43.860
One way binding to give that control a default value and 2 were binding to instantly outputted or do

02:43.860 --> 02:46.330
whatever you want to do with that value
