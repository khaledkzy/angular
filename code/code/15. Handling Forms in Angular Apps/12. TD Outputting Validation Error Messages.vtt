00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.660
In the last lecture we improve the user experience by taking advantage of the form State handled by

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.070
angular.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.700
Now let's improve this even more and let's say we want to output some help text Lotus empowered to assist

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.520
if there is an invalid value in there.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:26.200
Now we can use a bootstrap class your help block to make sure that this has the appropriate styling

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.760
and then we could say Please enter a valid email.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.010
We only want to show this if a valid point choose me if an invalid value has been entered into the control

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.240
associated with this input.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.640
Well a quick and easy way of getting access to the control created by angler automatically as we added

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.600
and you modeled the input is by adding a local reference to this input element here.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.800
For example email any name you like and associating this now not with any form as we did for the Oberle

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.340
form but with Engy model.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.970
So just like the form directive automatically added by angler when it detects a form element the ends

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.780
you model directive you're also kind of exposes some additional information about the control it creates

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.780
for us on the overarching form by accessing Engy model.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.580
So if we could simply check or say that we want to attach this span here.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.600
If email is not valid so add exclamation mark at the beginning.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.740
Now if this if this reloads you'll see that help text.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.940
And of course you can improve this by changing a number condition.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.200
That email should have been attached to give the user a chance of changing it.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.810
So now you don't see the warning but if you click in there and click out of there and it is invalid

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.170
you see that warning.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.360
And if you now enter a valid data it disappears.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.990
So this is another way of taking advantage of the state managed by angler.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.820
But does all that shows you how you can get a quick and easy access to control added by Engler.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:15.670
And with that you should have tools to really provide a pleasant user experience showing the right arrows

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.110
the right warnings and styling the form correctly depending on the state of the form
