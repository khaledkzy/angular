00:02.650 --> 00:08.050
We're nearing the end of the first part off this section the template driven approach.

00:08.050 --> 00:13.030
There are still some things I want to show you for example of how to work with radio buttons.

00:13.030 --> 00:19.620
We don't have any radio buttons in our form as of now so let's add some let's add a property in Yapp

00:19.630 --> 00:21.700
component first with some gender's.

00:21.760 --> 00:27.790
So this is simply an array where I have male and female and I don't want to insult anyone I know there

00:27.790 --> 00:33.810
are more genders nowaday I'm going to go with the classic approach here just to keep it simple.

00:33.910 --> 00:39.030
We have this gender's array and now with that array I want to output genders here.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.170
So let's say below our.

00:41.200 --> 00:47.730
Your reply paragraph your or add a new div with a class of radio

00:50.340 --> 00:55.230
and this death should be replicated for all the genders.

00:55.290 --> 01:02.580
So I'll I'm going to loop through my genders maybe bind to a gender variable and this is just a set

01:02.580 --> 01:05.880
of bootstrap uses to give to give to some nice styling of course.

01:05.880 --> 01:12.950
Use any Aberlour set up to style your your buttons here and looping ruled genders.

01:13.140 --> 01:17.270
And now again in the boot strebel to make a trait a nice looking radio button.

01:17.310 --> 01:21.940
I'm going to wrap it in a label this input here which is of Taieb radio.

01:22.200 --> 01:28.460
And I'm going to wrap this over multiple lines too just to make it all super simple to read and to understand.

01:28.840 --> 01:34.800
And here I will give it a name of gender because an array but I can only select one of them in a group

01:34.940 --> 01:35.430
cell.

01:35.430 --> 01:42.360
The name should be gender for whichever button is selected and it will place Engy model on it to make

01:42.360 --> 01:43.670
it a control.

01:44.010 --> 01:51.230
And I will pre-populated will set the value off the Spartan equal to gender.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.430
So this variable of my energy for loop.

01:54.900 --> 02:01.960
Now with that if we save this we should see that we have some gender buttons to output a text.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.600
I need to add it here after my input.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.370
So again gender here.

02:06.410 --> 02:08.200
Like Dat.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.560
And now we have male and female here.

02:10.650 --> 02:16.830
And if I just Antro something so that I can submit the form and I pick male here you will see that on

02:16.830 --> 02:18.720
the value object your.

02:18.990 --> 02:27.450
We got gender which is male and of course if I pick a female this will you guessed it be set to female.

02:27.450 --> 02:33.300
So this is how you can easily incorporate the radio buttons by binding or by placing end Jamal on the

02:33.510 --> 02:40.320
input as always setting the value of course you could all the hard code to value and that well makes

02:40.320 --> 02:42.630
it usable just like any other input.

02:42.810 --> 02:48.480
And if you want to set it to a default Chenda of course you can use one way binding again to make sure

02:48.480 --> 02:53.070
that one of the two buttons is selected by default at the start.

02:53.070 --> 03:02.360
When you load the form you can also of course add the required directive or attributes to that input

03:02.370 --> 03:09.310
here to make sure that now the form will not be valid until one of the two has been selected.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.620
So that works just like when any other input.

03:11.730 --> 03:17.490
So I just want to highlight this because radio buttons can look like a very special case.

03:17.520 --> 03:24.870
They are and they are used like any average input when using the template TROM approach in your angular

03:24.930 --> 03:25.410
app
