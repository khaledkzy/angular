Our form has evolved quite a bit.

00:05.720 --> 00:12.320
Now let's say that on the value object we get when we submit the form we want to group some things.

00:12.350 --> 00:18.380
For example we want to group the secret into question answer enter username and e-mail to just have

00:18.380 --> 00:22.490
some structure in our object because we're a very big form.

00:22.550 --> 00:25.210
We might want to have such a structure.

00:25.250 --> 00:33.170
This would also be nice if we could then validate the validity the status of our individual groups of

00:33.200 --> 00:34.280
inputs.

00:34.280 --> 00:38.440
Turns out that's easy to do with the template driven approach here.

00:38.540 --> 00:45.350
On our first group user name and email I already have a wrapping div with the user data here.

00:45.470 --> 00:48.140
Now you can simply place a number directive on it.

00:48.140 --> 00:55.160
The energy model group directive like this and this will now group this into.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.570
Well you guessed it a group of inputs.

00:57.590 --> 01:03.360
However Engy small group needs to be set equal to a string.

01:03.620 --> 01:05.360
So for example user data.

01:05.540 --> 01:09.350
This will be the key name for this group.

01:09.350 --> 01:18.200
So now if I save this with Engy small group added If I ENTRAR value here and here and submit and we

01:18.200 --> 01:23.960
have a look at the value of the form you'll now see that we have a user data field here which holds

01:23.960 --> 01:28.240
a number object where we now have email and user name.

01:28.250 --> 01:37.730
Now not only did we add this extra field in our value we also now have a different set up here in controls

01:37.970 --> 01:38.210
here.

01:38.270 --> 01:45.260
We also now have a user data control with all the properties you know on those controls like valid and

01:45.260 --> 01:46.200
so on.

01:46.550 --> 01:55.260
So if we now simply inspect our criminal code and Dave with the ID user data you'll see that there all

01:55.270 --> 01:59.150
to we got the entry dirth detached and valid classes added.

01:59.300 --> 02:06.110
So what you can now also check D-Va. letter to you Office overall code control you have for example

02:06.170 --> 02:09.760
which might be a nice feature in your form.

02:09.770 --> 02:17.720
You can also get access to the javascript representation by again adding a local rough reference to

02:17.720 --> 02:20.970
the element which holds the ends you model a group directive.

02:21.190 --> 02:28.270
Here for example user data I would be a fitting name and then setting this equal to ngi small group.

02:28.280 --> 02:34.100
So just like we did before with e-mail which was equal to Engy model and now setting this reference

02:34.100 --> 02:38.570
equal to Engy model group to get access to the javascript object.

02:38.900 --> 02:45.040
And this would allow us to for example output a message if this whole group is not valid.

02:45.110 --> 02:58.080
So we could simply output a paragraph your user data is invalid which we add if user data is a local

02:58.080 --> 02:59.720
reference created here.

03:00.460 --> 03:03.410
If user data is not valid.

03:03.610 --> 03:06.000
And let's say it has been touched.

03:06.160 --> 03:12.940
So user data attached is true with dad if this reloads.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.860
You'll see that we don't see any message.

03:14.870 --> 03:18.530
But as soon as I click into one of the fields and then leave it.

03:18.620 --> 03:21.020
You'll see user data as invalid was shown.

03:21.020 --> 03:27.690
So now you really got a very fine grained control over your form with all these tools.
