00:02.770 --> 00:06.000
So in the last lectures we added validation.

00:06.100 --> 00:12.610
Now as a template driven approach we can now use this form status to display messages.

00:12.850 --> 00:18.220
But it works a bit differently because we access the controls differently.

00:18.220 --> 00:22.680
Let's say we want to display a message below the input here for the user name.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.840
If that is incorrect.

00:23.980 --> 00:29.680
So I'll add a span with a class of help block again that bootstrap class and I'll say Please enter a

00:29.680 --> 00:34.330
valid username like this.

00:34.330 --> 00:40.060
Now I want a template of the approach we would place username on this and Asay and you modeled to get

00:40.060 --> 00:44.860
the reference this doesn't work here because again this is not set up by any model.

00:44.860 --> 00:49.990
This is not registered by our energy model but it's still very easy.

00:49.990 --> 00:55.800
We can simply add NGF of course because you want to determine whether to display this or not.

00:56.200 --> 01:01.530
And then we can get access to this by accessing our overall form.

01:01.630 --> 01:10.130
And here we have a get method to get method allows us to get access to our controls easily here.

01:10.330 --> 01:15.040
You can either specify the control name or I will come back to this later.

01:15.040 --> 01:21.730
The path to the control now for now the payoff is to name because we only have one level of nesting

01:21.730 --> 01:26.140
in our Form object and your name is username.

01:26.140 --> 01:32.110
So this gives us access to this user name control and now Valot holds whoever does control is available

01:32.170 --> 01:33.070
or not.

01:33.070 --> 01:35.890
So if it's not valid I want to output this.

01:36.070 --> 01:42.790
And of course again to give the user a chance to do to change it I'll also check if I sign up for him

01:43.540 --> 01:47.950
get username actually was touched.

01:48.310 --> 01:54.180
So by adding this we should see no messages displayed for click in there and click out of there.

01:54.220 --> 01:58.190
We see the error and if I enter something valid it's gone again.

01:58.360 --> 02:05.490
So this is how easy you can get access to a control in your form and with this get help or method.

02:05.740 --> 02:10.200
Now I will repeat this for the e-mail here.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.130
So we load the input here.

02:12.160 --> 02:18.010
I will simply exchange username for email and I will do it for the overall forum.

02:18.040 --> 02:24.880
Here I can simply remove this get access here and just execute the ballot and touched on the overall

02:24.880 --> 02:27.790
form which of course also has these properties.

02:27.790 --> 02:35.590
So please enter valid Dator might be the right message here and up your e-mail it should be please enter

02:35.590 --> 02:36.960
a valid e-mail.

02:36.970 --> 02:42.310
So with this in place we should see nothing right now if I click in here and out of there we see the

02:42.310 --> 02:49.960
message for the username as before and for the overall form which is still there because e-mail is invalid.

02:50.140 --> 02:55.370
But now if I enter something ballot there we don't see if it remove this we see the message for the

02:55.480 --> 02:56.320
field here.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.360
And for the overall form again.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.070
So now we're using the forms date again.

03:02.200 --> 03:08.710
And of course keep in mind these see us as classes ngi touched engine Valot are still added.

03:08.920 --> 03:18.430
So you can still go to your C S S code and say I input with Engy invalid and Engy tach should still

03:18.430 --> 03:23.180
receive a border which is red for example.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.750
So that is still possible.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.720
The classes are the same as in the template driven approach.

03:27.850 --> 03:29.600
So now that click in there and leave it.

03:29.680 --> 03:34.830
You'll see it now has a red border which disappears as soon as the value becomes valid.

03:35.050 --> 03:41.100
So this is how you can still use the form stayed important take away you access your elements differently

03:41.230 --> 03:45.080
with this get help or Moffit to conveniently get access to them.
