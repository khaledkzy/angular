00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:09.020
In the last video we added a couple of pipes the uppercase pipefitters for the instance type and the

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.170
date type to transform the type.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.880
But as I mentioned at the end of the last video it would be nice if you could configure a pipe because

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.920
this lay out here this way of displaying the date might not be did lay out the format of the data you

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.900
want to output so would be nice if it could parameterize apply.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.430
And we can for example on the date here we can add a parameter to configure to apply it by adding a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.060
colon.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.480
And this is the case where any pipe you configure it you pass a parameter to it by adding a colon.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.570
Of course the pipe needs to be able to handle a parameter.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.840
And again I will come back to where to find out how these pipes work or what the build and pipes do

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.210
how they can be configured in a second that they pipe can take a parameter room and we simply added

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.760
after this colon.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.940
Now Dave pipe expects to receive a String parameter.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.380
So let's pass a string and there you basically set up the date.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.340
I'll come back to the options you have in a second.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.390
Now for the moment let's just enter full date camel case.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.890
So a capital D.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:27.100
Let's save this and go back to our application and you see now we get a better format to date.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.930
Now might still not be what you want but again I will come back to our options in a second.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.260
It is what I like to see here and this is how easy you can parameterize a pipe you can pass parameters

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.480
by simply adding a colon and then the parameter as a side note if you would have multiple parameters

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.110
here you'll simply separate them with additional colons.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.470
So the date pi doesn't take an additional parameter but if it would you could pass it by adding a number

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.110
column and then the second parameter.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.320
Now with this basic functionality set let's have a look at where you can learn more about the built

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.530
in pipes and how you can configure them.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.520
Let's dive into this and the next lecture.
