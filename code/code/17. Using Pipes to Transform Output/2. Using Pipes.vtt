I get a little exampled project set up here and you can find it attached to this video.

00:08.150 --> 00:14.120
Now the code responsible for what you saw here on the screen is basically this app component template

00:14.210 --> 00:20.560
where I output a list of servers and the servers are stored here in my app component type and file.

00:20.570 --> 00:26.270
I got the service array which simply holds a couple of Java object each representing a server and then

00:26.270 --> 00:32.060
at the bottom here I got a helper class which simply retrieves the right C SS classes which should be

00:32.060 --> 00:36.050
attached to dead list group item depending on the state of the server.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.110
If it's stable or of line.

00:38.510 --> 00:40.820
So this is the project we're starting with.

00:40.940 --> 00:45.000
It looks all right but it get a couple of things we could fix here.

00:45.050 --> 00:51.750
Now for example we get a server name which looks all right to me but then we get this instance type

00:51.750 --> 00:55.980
here medium large small and we get the state.

00:56.030 --> 01:03.990
Now you could for example put this instance type to be all uppercase and the date.

01:04.130 --> 01:06.660
I'd like to change something about the state too.

01:06.830 --> 01:13.340
But let's start with the instance type medium large small here to see how to use pipes and you will

01:13.340 --> 01:16.970
see it's actually pretty simple to change it.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.650
We have to go to the template to the HMO file because remember our pipe is only responsible for transforming

01:24.650 --> 01:25.340
the output.

01:25.400 --> 01:30.150
So the right place to use it logically is the template.

01:30.170 --> 01:34.940
Now here I want to change this server instance type thing here.

01:34.940 --> 01:37.760
I'll just bring it into a new line here.

01:38.030 --> 01:42.850
And the same for server started just to make it a bit easier to read.

01:43.280 --> 01:48.320
And now I would like does server instance type to be uppercase.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.740
Now that's easy to achieve.

01:49.760 --> 01:55.290
We just add the pipe symbol hence the name pipes and then the name of the pipe.

01:55.310 --> 02:00.400
And as mentioned before there are a couple of built in pipes and you can also build pipes on your own.

02:00.410 --> 02:02.690
We will have a look at this in one of the next lectures.

02:02.780 --> 02:08.420
Now a good built in pipe for making this or briquets of course is the apprecate pipe you saw in the

02:08.420 --> 02:11.690
slide before with that added you.

02:11.720 --> 02:19.310
Now see if you save this and go back to your web page that all the instance types here have been called

02:19.310 --> 02:21.570
Word to be uppercase.

02:21.620 --> 02:29.590
So without changing anything else without that that's important changing the property itself your status

02:29.620 --> 02:35.700
as excuse me the instance types are still lowercase without changing anything here.

02:35.810 --> 02:40.490
We changed the way users can view it simply by adding a pipe here.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.950
That looks pretty good to me.

02:42.990 --> 02:49.810
Now let's move on to the date and for this we get a number pi we could use.

02:49.970 --> 02:56.540
So if we have a look at the HMO code here the server started output here is responsible for rendering

02:56.540 --> 02:57.280
the date.

02:57.560 --> 03:04.100
Well if we add the pipes symbol here to we could add the date pipe and now a built in type and it will

03:04.100 --> 03:08.700
come back to where you find those built in pipes in a second.

03:08.720 --> 03:14.890
Now with this added Let's save this and now you see out of the box.

03:14.930 --> 03:20.690
This looks much nicer but it might not be the way you want it to look.

03:20.690 --> 03:25.960
So let's learn more about how to configure pipes in the next video.
