In the last lecture we parameterised our first year that they'd pipe.

00:07.080 --> 00:12.450
Now let's learn more about all the built in pipes and how we can configure them the place to learn more

00:12.650 --> 00:14.580
is the official documentation.

00:14.640 --> 00:19.180
So you can't just head to angular dot IO and there are docs.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.280
Click on API reference.

00:21.300 --> 00:26.190
Now you may ignore the words number up here it should be four point something at the point of time you

00:26.190 --> 00:27.100
viewed it did you.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.280
I'm just recording this in advance.

00:29.460 --> 00:33.740
But the pipes won't change or haven't changed.

00:33.750 --> 00:41.810
So here you can enter pipe as a filter and then you view all the pipes which are built into angular.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.150
And there you see we get a couple of them.

00:44.220 --> 00:47.680
We already used to date pipe and the uppercase pipe.

00:47.860 --> 00:53.750
There also is a slice pipe which allows you to take a slice of the input and there you would see that

00:53.750 --> 01:00.120
the sliced pipe actually takes multiple arguments to start and end so where it should start slicing

01:00.120 --> 01:03.070
out a piece of the word and where it should and.

01:03.340 --> 01:07.140
You can also give you a detailed explanation and an example.

01:07.140 --> 01:12.480
So this is really a great place to dive into pipes and play around with them since there is not much

01:12.480 --> 01:14.660
sense in covering them all in detail here.

01:14.670 --> 01:20.550
But you buy video as they are very specific in the use case and the documentation here is really great

01:20.550 --> 01:22.250
for diving deeper into it.

01:22.620 --> 01:27.780
So with that out of the way I want to have a look at the date pipe here.

01:27.810 --> 01:30.370
You can see how you can configure it.

01:30.450 --> 01:34.480
You can see a couple of different shortcuts for getting a specific date format.

01:34.710 --> 01:41.410
Or you can form it from scratch with the typical symbols like lowercase D for a day and so on.

01:41.550 --> 01:47.340
So this is where you can dive into how to make the data look exactly how you wanted to look.

01:47.340 --> 01:52.030
Now with that let's move on to creating a road pipe or all those moved to that point.

01:52.140 --> 01:54.310
One other thing and then you move on
