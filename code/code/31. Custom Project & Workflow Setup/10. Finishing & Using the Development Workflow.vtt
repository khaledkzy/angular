WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:07.680
In the last lecture we finished a configuration of all the while conflict falls for our workflow.

00:07.750 --> 00:12.880
Now in the package Jason File I want to add a new script here and the script section and I will name

00:12.880 --> 00:13.470
it build.

00:13.480 --> 00:20.320
The name is up to you though and I want to run my web page dev server in inline mode.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.410
I want to lock the progress.

00:22.480 --> 00:29.030
You can set the ports here like this alternative to ADHD and I want to use a specific config file.

00:29.020 --> 00:32.780
The webpage conflict that def started Jarius file.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.620
Now with this let's try running it.

00:34.630 --> 00:37.510
Let's try running NPM run built.

00:37.680 --> 00:38.580
Does looks OK.

00:38.590 --> 00:44.520
Let's now wisit the page and we get an error here.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.560
This error is pretty clear.

00:46.610 --> 00:48.760
No base ref set.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.260
So it's an error on my part.

00:50.270 --> 00:56.720
We need to adjust our age table file and set the base ref here in the head section so that Engler knows

00:56.840 --> 00:59.120
what our base your L is.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.510
So let's say does it will automatically recompile.

01:01.520 --> 01:06.140
And that looks much better we see the home page and we can switch the user's page.

01:06.230 --> 01:08.230
Let's see if lazy loading works.

01:08.240 --> 01:11.370
I'll go to a network page and reload this app.

01:13.820 --> 01:19.630
Make sure to disable caches checked here and now watch the network click on users.

01:19.670 --> 01:21.250
It loaded the chunk.

01:21.340 --> 01:23.770
So Dad is all working credit good.

01:23.780 --> 01:28.040
Let's now work on the production workflow using ahead of time computation.
