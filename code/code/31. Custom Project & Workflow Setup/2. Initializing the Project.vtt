To start from scratch I would start by initialising this with NPM in it.

00:07.580 --> 00:13.250
To put this under control of NPM which I will of course use to manage all the dependencies my development

00:13.370 --> 00:15.120
my production dependencies.

00:15.190 --> 00:19.910
So after hitting Enter we have to answer a couple of questions and you can basically hit enter all the

00:19.910 --> 00:25.580
time or change it to fit your needs and once you are done you should have this package touchiest and

00:25.590 --> 00:28.800
fall with the basic info you entered or where you pressed.

00:28.820 --> 00:34.430
OK now this is the file which will then store our dependencies to and where we will later create our

00:34.430 --> 00:37.580
development scripts or workflow scripts.

00:37.580 --> 00:44.930
Now with the parritch initialized Let's start by creating the folder structure we want to use for this

00:45.000 --> 00:45.990
set up here.
