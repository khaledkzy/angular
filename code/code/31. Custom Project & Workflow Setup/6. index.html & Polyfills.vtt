The last lecture was quite a lot of work creating that basic angular app..

00:06.290 --> 00:08.430
Let's now work on the index age team Ulfar.

00:08.450 --> 00:14.240
So on our single page I'll create an age of five skeleton here and you can simply download one from

00:14.240 --> 00:18.780
the Internet if your idea or editor doesn't have a quick way of generating one.

00:18.830 --> 00:25.030
I'll give this a name or a title of angler's seed all the metal text you're OK.

00:25.250 --> 00:31.990
And I will add at root here and I'll say loading in between so that we can see something Watson is loading

00:32.000 --> 00:38.260
Yep I don't edit script import because my workflow web peg will do this automatically later.

00:38.360 --> 00:46.060
App root of course is the selector of my root component here that's the index age HTML file of finished.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.200
Let's now work on the POLLI falls.

00:48.230 --> 00:49.800
We installed Korczak Yes.

00:49.890 --> 00:57.210
And all I need to do here is I need to set or import coordinates as sex to get some features of ESX

00:57.320 --> 01:00.930
6 to be supported across browsers and Gorgie.

01:00.950 --> 01:02.520
Yes yes.

01:02.540 --> 01:08.420
7 And here we need to reflect API basically.

01:08.550 --> 01:19.400
I will also require soan dot J.S. slash dist slash Soden and I did three required as due to the way

01:19.400 --> 01:24.320
to Sanches package is well packaged and how we can import from it.

01:24.590 --> 01:31.550
Now with that created I'll go back to the main Katia's file and here at the top I now also want to reach

01:31.550 --> 01:37.280
out to the the fields fall and make sure that this gets imported and is part of our overall bundle and

01:37.280 --> 01:44.120
important I place it in this file at the top by purpose because this Poley fields fall should be loaded

01:44.120 --> 01:47.440
first because otherwise of Java code transfer as well.

01:47.480 --> 01:52.580
The other browsers don't benefit from the Poley feels being added that at the end we're being loaded

01:52.580 --> 01:55.410
at the end that is already too late.

01:55.460 --> 01:58.640
So dad is in HD and Poley Fultz finished.

01:58.640 --> 02:03.470
Now let's continue and let's set up our development workflow.
