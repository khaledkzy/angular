00:02.620 --> 00:06.420
We created our app the next age HTML file and the Poley files file.

00:06.430 --> 00:11.270
Now it's time to work on the actual workflow using Westpac.

00:11.430 --> 00:14.600
So for this I need to install a couple of packages.

00:14.620 --> 00:22.680
I will use NPM install for this and now I will store them why save death as they are development dependencies.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.910
Now here we need Westpac.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.520
We all need the web.

00:27.580 --> 00:34.900
Dev server so that we have a development server serving our app during development I guess so the next

00:34.900 --> 00:44.860
thing we need is the angular router loader we alternate angular to template loader and even though it's

00:44.860 --> 00:48.900
named angler's Q10 loader it works fine for angle of 4 too.

00:49.300 --> 00:58.210
I also need the awesome typescript loader to be able to parse hypopnea into compile typescript in my

00:58.210 --> 01:05.970
web page workflow and I need the HDMI loader to handle my age HTML templates.

01:06.100 --> 01:11.760
We can add to roll load for a year and I need to add typescript.

01:11.800 --> 01:18.360
I also want to add D-Del. Seelye so that we can delete files during our workflows.

01:18.370 --> 01:23.530
Specifically I want to delete some files after the ahead of time compilation finished and I want to

01:23.530 --> 01:27.960
delete the disk folder before we create a new one each time we run that command.

01:28.330 --> 01:36.220
So now I hit enter to install these packages as development packages and with these packages all installed

01:36.610 --> 01:42.490
in the next lecture we can start setting up our t s conflict follower types and configuration and the

01:42.490 --> 01:43.400
web page workflow.
