Welcome to this course module now for this course we use to Selye and I strongly recommend using the

00:09.190 --> 00:10.470
Seelye to be honest.

00:10.660 --> 00:14.550
Well it has some issues and might have the occasional bug.

00:14.650 --> 00:20.660
It is a great tool and it makes starting with angular and managing your angle project so much easier.

00:20.770 --> 00:26.170
Still it might be interesting to know how you can set up your own develop and the words flow your own

00:26.170 --> 00:27.970
project from scratch.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.390
And this is what I'm doing here.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.410
So I start with an empty folder.

00:31.450 --> 00:38.260
Besides my good ignore file here and now we will use this folder to create our own angler from scratch

00:38.350 --> 00:39.480
using WePay.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.150
So let's start with this in the next lecture.
