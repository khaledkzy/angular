00:02.390 --> 00:08.430
So we need angular the framework so that we're actually able to create our first app.

00:08.570 --> 00:15.370
I will use NPM to install it and I will store all these packages as production dependencies.

00:15.370 --> 00:17.720
Why a D dash dash save command.

00:18.050 --> 00:19.690
Now we need a couple of packages.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.000
We need angular core.

00:22.220 --> 00:24.720
We need angular common.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.920
We need angular compiler.

00:27.920 --> 00:33.100
We need angular compilers sealife we're all flying compilation.

00:33.170 --> 00:35.350
We need angular forms.

00:35.480 --> 00:42.110
We need angular HTB we need a singular platform browser.

00:42.260 --> 00:50.330
We need a singular platform browser dynamic and you can find all these packages of course in the package

00:50.330 --> 00:53.000
adjacent fall of your A C live project.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.680
We need a singular platform server if you want to run some server side code with angular Universal which

01:00.680 --> 01:02.010
I won't cover here though.

01:02.210 --> 01:05.830
We need a regular router and potentially alter aler upgrade.

01:05.830 --> 01:12.620
I'm just going to install them all here now with that we've got a lot of things installed.

01:12.710 --> 01:20.630
Now let's hit enter and NPM will download them at the dependencies in the packet as a file and stored

01:20.630 --> 01:23.760
the downloaded files in the node Mark Shields folder.

01:23.810 --> 01:30.530
So now it is finished we can see the package start Jason follow ups this file here that we installed

01:30.530 --> 01:37.230
quite a lot of dependencies here but we still missing a couple of core dependencies.

01:37.640 --> 01:44.570
Dad would be again with NPM installed Ashtar save as production dependencies on X chips which is needed

01:44.570 --> 01:47.810
for observables so for HGP for example.

01:47.810 --> 01:55.460
So not geas which is used for change detection by angular and chorded Cheras which is a poll useful

01:55.550 --> 01:58.440
so that it runs in on all browsers basically.

01:58.590 --> 02:05.030
So it again hit enter so that these packages are also downloaded and added to the package to adjacent

02:05.030 --> 02:06.060
file.

02:06.080 --> 02:10.840
And now with that we have everything we should need to create or angular app..

02:10.850 --> 02:13.190
So let's do that in the next lecture.
