00:02.570 --> 00:05.770
In the last lecture we installed all the dependencies we need.

00:05.810 --> 00:10.870
Now let's start filling our files with some life Astara in the main or TS file.

00:11.080 --> 00:25.120
And here first of all want to import my platform browser dynamic function from ET angular platform browser

00:25.120 --> 00:27.950
dynamic and that's it.

00:28.390 --> 00:33.230
I also need an import and that is my app module.

00:33.520 --> 00:42.540
Now I will import AB module from dot slash app module However this will show an error right now because

00:42.550 --> 00:46.080
app module doesn't export at module it's an empty file right now.

00:46.090 --> 00:47.850
But we'll it's as soon.

00:47.950 --> 00:53.830
So now I will use the platform browser dynamic function executed and then called Bootstrap module and

00:53.830 --> 00:56.410
pass AB module like this.

00:56.410 --> 00:58.930
Now let's work on the app module next year.

00:58.940 --> 01:04.130
I will export app modules so that we don't get this error and you may not Tia's father anymore.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.700
Whoops should be a class though.

01:06.700 --> 01:12.550
And with that I of course need to add Engy module to it and that needs to be imported from at angular

01:12.580 --> 01:14.100
court now.

01:14.290 --> 01:18.450
DNG module of course needs declarations aere as you learned.

01:18.640 --> 01:27.770
We probably will use some imports then we might have some providers and we might also have something

01:27.790 --> 01:29.410
want to bootstrap of course.

01:29.410 --> 01:31.420
So our app component later on.

01:31.420 --> 01:38.680
Now speaking of that let's go to the app component file and export a class here to the app component

01:38.920 --> 01:39.730
class.

01:41.420 --> 01:46.120
And hirable at at component which is imported from.

01:46.130 --> 01:50.590
At a singular core and here of course I configure my app component.

01:50.660 --> 01:59.780
I will give it a select or of app route and a template you are l which points to with a relative path

01:59.930 --> 02:02.830
app dot component dot aged him l.

02:02.850 --> 02:09.070
I'll also add style you are L's and point to app data component.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.670
Don't see us as here.

02:10.970 --> 02:15.190
That's my app component with that created back in the app module.

02:15.200 --> 02:23.850
I can add added two declarations AB component and make sure to add to import to appear and the same

02:23.850 --> 02:25.430
for bootstrap here.

02:25.530 --> 02:27.780
I will also add the up component now.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.250
So if the big get the main TS We get the app component.

02:31.260 --> 02:37.880
Now of course we all need to see something so N-th team will file opt of the app component.

02:37.890 --> 02:41.380
I will say hello world for now.

02:41.940 --> 02:45.810
But then I'll add a horizontal line and I also want to use routing.

02:46.020 --> 02:54.020
So even though we haven't set up a router module yet I will add ankar tech with router link and I will

02:54.020 --> 03:02.630
simply use the to work with our property Beinecke chust point to just slash here and here to users and

03:02.630 --> 03:09.160
hearable say users and for the first one I will just say home and I'll add a neighborhood is on the

03:09.160 --> 03:15.290
line and then the router outlet so here that should get loaded in the end so that's the app component

03:15.380 --> 03:17.870
almost finished in the styling file.

03:17.870 --> 03:23.300
I want to give this age one tag a little Starling's so that you can see the styling worked.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.790
I will set the color to red.

03:25.940 --> 03:30.580
So just to see that DC s s tiling was imported successfully.

03:30.780 --> 03:34.330
Now with Dad we can set up the routing in the app routing module.

03:34.670 --> 03:45.380
Here I will export a class of course the app routing module and this class will receive DNG module decorator

03:45.380 --> 03:53.300
which as before it is imported from an English core in days decorator we don't need declarations.

03:53.300 --> 04:00.650
What I do need here though is the imports array because I want to import my router module here and then

04:00.680 --> 04:02.850
I want to export it of course.

04:03.200 --> 04:08.270
So what I want to do here is set up my routes I'll do this in a constant.

04:08.270 --> 04:17.430
My app routes maybe which is of type routes so that set this type and imported from a single or router.

04:17.680 --> 04:23.860
And that is an array of routes as you learned in the routing section and now the routes I want to set

04:23.860 --> 04:26.010
up here are two routes.

04:26.050 --> 04:29.000
The first one is empty Poth the home route.

04:29.140 --> 04:35.770
Here I want to add a component or want to navigate to a component the home component which I need to

04:35.770 --> 04:46.030
import so I need to import home component from the slash home component file and we don't export the

04:46.030 --> 04:48.640
home component in India right now that it will not work.

04:48.640 --> 04:54.860
As of now the second thing is here the path leading to users.

04:55.060 --> 04:57.420
And that should use lazy loading here.

04:57.580 --> 05:02.940
So hirable say load children and point to dot slash users.

05:02.980 --> 05:07.700
So to the users folder there to the user's module.

05:07.870 --> 05:16.030
This fall here and in there I will name this users module so this should later lazily load as users

05:16.030 --> 05:17.760
component.

05:17.800 --> 05:27.910
Now I can import a router module here imported from getting the router set for root or call for root

05:27.940 --> 05:29.700
and pass my app routes.

05:29.890 --> 05:32.470
And of course export the router module here.

05:32.740 --> 05:38.980
And with that I can go to my app module and import my app routing module.

05:38.980 --> 05:41.960
Make sure to add the import lbf too.

05:42.040 --> 05:51.030
With that in place I can go to the home component and export my class home component you're like dis

05:52.420 --> 05:58.400
And of course add the component decorator which is imported from at a regular court.

05:58.420 --> 06:03.940
Now for the home component here I don't specify a selector because I'm going to loaded why a routing

06:04.360 --> 06:10.330
I will set up an inline template where I simply have H-1 the home page.

06:10.330 --> 06:15.020
So a very simple template in the app routing module does should now work.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.750
Component works in AB module.

06:17.770 --> 06:23.850
I will add it to the declarations aere home component and at the import BAAF.

06:23.860 --> 06:26.700
So that is the first part finished.

06:26.740 --> 06:30.380
Let's now work on the users section in that section.

06:30.400 --> 06:37.040
I want to go to the users component typescript files to components so to say add a class export user's

06:38.110 --> 06:39.450
component here.

06:39.820 --> 06:48.030
And you guessed it I'll add at component as a decorator imported from an Anglo core.

06:48.310 --> 06:54.370
I don't need a selector because I'm going to loaded why a routing I will set up a template you are ELB

06:54.380 --> 07:04.110
pointing to the user is component Daut aged him file and it will set up dishtowel you or else properties

07:04.130 --> 07:10.040
you're pointing to users component Dud's see is as.

07:10.380 --> 07:20.490
Now in these files and the HMO fall at age 1 tech user's component here and it is as false styled as

07:20.490 --> 07:24.960
age one tag to give it a color of green maybe.

07:25.020 --> 07:27.900
So again we can see that this worked.

07:27.930 --> 07:37.410
Now I'll go to my users routing module export a class your users routing module like dat and you guessed

07:37.410 --> 07:45.280
it adds d g module decorator imported from an Anglo core of course and here.

07:45.330 --> 07:51.780
Now again I'll add my imports array and my exports array and then imports.

07:51.780 --> 07:58.520
I want to use router module for child now and I'll keep this really simple.

07:58.530 --> 08:00.870
That's all right it's inline here even.

08:01.020 --> 08:06.630
I'll add my array of route's Tudor's function it'll only hold one roud one object.

08:06.630 --> 08:15.090
Here the path is an empty string and the component will be the user's component which I import here.

08:15.270 --> 08:22.410
So with that I can now export the router module here and I can go back to my user base module export

08:22.530 --> 08:32.250
dishcloths users module and add at Angi module here to like that.

08:33.130 --> 08:44.430
And then here finally now I want to add declarations to declare my user as component and then want to

08:44.490 --> 08:53.160
import something I want to import my users routing module here and to import pauvres at the top of course

08:54.030 --> 09:00.900
I also want to add the common module let's say in case that we wanted to use some common directive so

09:00.900 --> 09:05.200
make sure to import this from at angular common for the same reason.

09:05.270 --> 09:11.520
I just go to the app Marchal And besides importing the app routing module here I want to import the

09:11.520 --> 09:16.220
browser module to get some basic functionality which we need for angular.

09:16.350 --> 09:24.420
So make sure to import browser module from etting platform browser to dead is the basic app created

09:24.420 --> 09:27.630
from the typescript angle or perspective.

09:27.660 --> 09:32.920
We still need to work on the index aged out and pulled the folds will do so in the next lecture.
