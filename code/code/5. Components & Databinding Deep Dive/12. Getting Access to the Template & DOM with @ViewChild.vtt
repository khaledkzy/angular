WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:06.050
And The Last Lecture we learned about local references.

00:06.190 --> 00:15.040
Now there is also another way of getting access to local references or to any element actually directly

00:15.040 --> 00:17.280
from within our typescript code.

00:17.290 --> 00:25.090
Right now we're passing the reference here when we call a method and that works fine but sometimes you

00:25.090 --> 00:27.650
want to get access before we call the method.

00:27.910 --> 00:32.540
And there is a nice decorator we can use in typescript to get this access.

00:32.740 --> 00:35.460
Let's do the same for the server content.

00:35.800 --> 00:42.960
So hearable quickly duplicate that input and comment out the old solution using two web winding and

00:42.960 --> 00:50.010
a new solution will not use two way binding but instead this will now also have a local reference the

00:50.030 --> 00:52.790
server content input maybe.

00:53.380 --> 01:01.090
Now in the cockpit component I will also comment out the old news server content here and I will add

01:01.180 --> 01:11.020
a new property which all name server content input no server content input like this is just a property

01:11.390 --> 01:14.920
but we can add at viewer child in front of it.

01:14.930 --> 01:16.920
This decorator with parentheses.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.530
And we need to import view child from an angle or core now view child like this won't work.

01:24.530 --> 01:31.280
We need to pass an argument here and this argument actually is de-select or of the element how we want

01:31.280 --> 01:36.370
to select the element and select or now not like s.c.s as selector.

01:36.500 --> 01:44.450
But for example we can simply pass as a string the name of a local reference so server content input

01:44.630 --> 01:46.810
could now be passed as a string.

01:47.420 --> 01:53.180
If you don't want to pass a string but want to select a component you could simply pass the component

01:53.210 --> 01:54.470
type here.

01:54.530 --> 02:00.470
So in clock and we don't use any other components but in Yapp component we could pass a cockpit component.

02:00.500 --> 02:07.270
So the type like does not like a string to get access to the first occurrence of this cockpit component

02:07.340 --> 02:08.970
in the app component.

02:09.020 --> 02:15.460
But here I'll switch just back to getting access to the local reference which probably is the use case

02:15.470 --> 02:17.240
you will see the most often.

02:17.510 --> 02:23.540
And with that we now get access to our server content input.

02:23.540 --> 02:26.230
Now what does this actually hold then.

02:26.450 --> 02:27.420
Let's quickly comment.

02:27.430 --> 02:29.950
Our kids are dead it doesn't break.

02:30.140 --> 02:39.800
And let's log this server content inputs our property here which is kind of set Frue view child.

02:39.800 --> 02:45.800
So with this if all to comment at this hour down here so that we can run our app and if I now safe this

02:45.800 --> 02:51.770
and we go back to our application and I enter something here and I click add server we see that this

02:51.770 --> 02:53.790
is a type element ref.

02:54.020 --> 03:00.170
So unlike the local reference we passed directly from the template wired method which was the element

03:00.170 --> 03:01.170
itself.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.370
This is of type element.

03:03.360 --> 03:11.300
RATH So we can set this type here element ref a reference to that element Element ref needs to be imported

03:11.300 --> 03:12.860
from an angle or core.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.470
It's a angular type.

03:15.470 --> 03:20.720
So this element ref however has a useful property we can use.

03:20.900 --> 03:26.300
And that's the native element property we can use server content.

03:26.390 --> 03:33.500
Whoops this server content input here and then native element to get access to the underlying element

03:33.950 --> 03:38.340
which now has a value because this will now be the input element.

03:38.900 --> 03:43.370
Now we can do the same of course for the on and blueprint method.

03:43.610 --> 03:52.100
And with this we get direct access to elements in our dorm in our template Frue at view child.

03:52.160 --> 04:00.360
And you should see that this now works again if we Andrew some content here and click the buttons works

04:00.360 --> 04:02.800
perfectly now without two way binding.

04:02.850 --> 04:10.880
But with local references past two methods or local references fetched through view child.

04:10.890 --> 04:17.880
Now one important thing to watch out for is you should not change the element fruitless because of course

04:18.210 --> 04:25.320
you could use our server can't input the native element and then set value to something right.

04:25.350 --> 04:31.980
You can do this and if we actually do that like this and I click at the blueprint you'll see something

04:31.980 --> 04:33.670
was added to year.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.810
I strongly recommend not doing this.

04:36.810 --> 04:43.320
You should not access to Dom like this angler offers you a better way of accessing the dawn and you

04:43.320 --> 04:46.020
will learn about this in the directives section.

04:46.230 --> 04:51.090
Generally you should use the other tools like string interpellation and property binding if you want

04:51.090 --> 04:56.690
to output something in the dorm and not directly mess with any elements you can get.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.820
Even though if you have gotten them through angular
