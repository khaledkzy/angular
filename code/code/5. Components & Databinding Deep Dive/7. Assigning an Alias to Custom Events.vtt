In the last lecture you'll learn how to use an output to enable average components to listen to your

00:08.870 --> 00:12.540
own custom events which you could create with event emitter.

00:12.890 --> 00:20.300
Now just like on an input on an output you also can assign an alias like here for blueprint creators.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.840
Maybe you want to name this be created now with this.

00:23.980 --> 00:27.770
This is the event you can listen to from outside.

00:27.800 --> 00:34.820
So the app component where we try to listen we now need to rename it here to and listen to be pre-created

00:35.030 --> 00:37.940
which is now just like on an input.

00:38.120 --> 00:42.880
The one and only event you can listen to when it comes to this blueprint created event.

00:43.040 --> 00:50.730
The other name blueprint created here will not be exposed to the outside anymore so it has to be BP

00:50.750 --> 00:51.240
created.

00:51.240 --> 00:55.170
Now all the rest stays unhatched and works just like before.
