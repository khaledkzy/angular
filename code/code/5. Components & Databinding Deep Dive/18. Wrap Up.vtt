00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.440
So throughout the section you'll learn a lot about components.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.740
We really had a deep dive on them.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.590
You learn how to use data binding with custom properties and events how to pass data around how to access

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.680
elements in your dorm how to use local references how to really create a dynamic app and how to use

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.230
lifecycle hooks to run some code at specific points of time.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.740
With that a lot of core features of Angler have been said now have been taught.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.190
Now it's time to of course practice them in the recipe book in the next module where we will enhance

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.900
it as with our new knowledge.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.700
And of course to play around with that knowledge in your own apps.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.770
So let's move onto the rest of the book before we dive deeper into directives.
