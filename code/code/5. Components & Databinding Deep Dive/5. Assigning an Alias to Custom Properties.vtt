In the last lecture we learn something crucial.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:13.330
We learned how to bind to our own properties with at input parentheses in front of it.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.330
Super important.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.460
Now you can even configure it as a bit more.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.800
Sometimes you don't want to use the same property outside of the component as you use inside of it.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.540
So inside this component you might say element is exactly the property name I want to use because it

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.070
makes the most sense but outside so here you maybe don't want to blind to element.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.260
Maybe you want to bind to as Arvi element to make clear as a server element anything like that.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.170
Now that would of course not work because now you would try to bind to a property angle or doesn't know

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.620
that it would be buyable.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.980
Because there is no server element property in this component with an input in front of it.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.370
You can assign an alias.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.970
You can pass an argument to an input with the property name as you want to have it.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.010
Outside of this component.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.860
So as Arvie element could be added here and now from the outside.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.490
So from the component where you implement this component you now have to target s r v element if you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.630
want to bind to this property element will no longer work.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.290
It has to be s r v element now which is why now with these two places changed in the component and in

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.400
the server element component we see the same as before but now binding for the alius.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.730
And just again to be really sure to make this really clear.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.070
Now you have to use as we element Element will no longer work.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.750
So that's a little bonus a little alternative in case you want to bind to some other property name outside

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.640
of the component.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.480
This is how you assign an alias
