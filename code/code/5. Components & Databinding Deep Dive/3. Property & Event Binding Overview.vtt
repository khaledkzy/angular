In the last lecture we split up our app into multiple components which is great that is why we use components.

00:08.720 --> 00:12.910
But one issue is that we need to pass data between these components.

00:13.200 --> 00:19.680
Now in the basics section we learn about property and event binding and there we used it to for example

00:19.740 --> 00:23.550
by the disabled property of our age m l element.

00:23.790 --> 00:28.140
So we kind of passed the data to that element.

00:28.140 --> 00:36.930
We passed the information that it should be disabled that is set to true to this HVM l element the same

00:36.930 --> 00:40.900
with UN binding when we click this AGM button.

00:41.070 --> 00:42.420
Something happened.

00:42.420 --> 00:46.110
This button emitted any event to which we were able to listen.

00:46.170 --> 00:49.510
So it's sent as some data to same for the input.

00:49.510 --> 00:53.760
Well we even used that data with Dollar Sign event if you remember this.

00:53.790 --> 00:57.600
There we get data from the input element.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.990
This is exactly the behavior we need now with our own components.

01:00.990 --> 01:08.130
We need to be able to send data into a component or receive data receive an event and Angola of course

01:08.370 --> 01:11.670
gives us great tools to implement this flow.

01:11.730 --> 01:17.490
We can use property in event binding not only on HDMI elements and their native properties and events

01:17.490 --> 01:19.300
as we did thus far.

01:19.410 --> 01:24.450
We can also use it on directives and we also did this with N-G Glosson and restyled.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.980
We use property binding but and that is important.

01:28.020 --> 01:34.920
We can also use it on our own components and bind to our own custom properties and custom events.

01:35.010 --> 01:36.940
We can embed our own events.

01:36.950 --> 01:41.760
That is what I'll dive into in the next lecture starting with custom property binding
