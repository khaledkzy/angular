00:02.530 --> 00:08.590
Let me quickly summarize what we've learned thus far because it really is important this component communication

00:08.740 --> 00:17.230
is such a key feature and with an input and the ability to make your properties bind them all from outside

00:17.440 --> 00:20.420
from the parent component using this component.

00:20.710 --> 00:26.530
And the same for ad output which allows parent components using this component to listen to your own

00:26.530 --> 00:29.520
events which you carried with you even the emitter.

00:29.710 --> 00:33.190
These are such important features in your app.

00:33.250 --> 00:40.570
We will use it in the recipe book in the next section because this really allows you to make your application

00:40.570 --> 00:41.560
very dynamic.

00:41.620 --> 00:45.900
Use many components and have them talk to each other.

00:45.940 --> 00:54.850
Now one issue you could say with that approach is that if you want to talk between two components sitting

00:54.850 --> 01:01.600
next to each other it can get kind of complicated to emit a meant in one component change something

01:01.600 --> 01:05.830
in the parent component and then pass this new data down to the child component.

01:06.100 --> 01:11.790
And these chains of inputs and outputs can really grow more complex.

01:12.100 --> 01:18.070
So what is absolutely fine here and this is a feature you will use a lot because it's not bad at all.

01:18.100 --> 01:24.460
There are some use cases where the distance between two components that should talk to each other is

01:24.460 --> 01:30.400
so great that building a chain of outputs and inputs is not very practical.

01:30.400 --> 01:38.140
That is why in the services section of discourse I will then show you another approach of having components

01:38.140 --> 01:40.630
talk to each other though and that is important.

01:40.630 --> 01:42.940
This will not be a better approach.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.760
It is just a better tool for a specific use case.

01:47.050 --> 01:52.460
I use case like this year is typically handled with input and output like we are doing it here.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.810
It's the perfect tool for this job and it's so important.

01:55.870 --> 01:59.810
You will see it getting used a lot for the rest of this course.
