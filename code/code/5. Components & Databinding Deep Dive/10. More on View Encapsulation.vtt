00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.160
In a class lecture you learn how angular encapsulates your styles.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.860
Now you can't override this encapsulations though if you go back to your code to the server element

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.980
component you can add something to the keyboard and decorator.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.330
It's called encapsulation this property and there is a value you can access view encapsulation which

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.670
needs to be imported from an English course to make sure to add import and then you can choose between

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.010
three modes.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.390
Emulator as the default.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.820
So you don't need to add this non If you add this what make sure that if we have a look at our component

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:52.390
again and we inspect our server element that now in here we don't see these strange attributes being

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.520
added to our elements.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.050
Therefore this component now does not use the new encapsulation.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.660
The average components still will use it.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.650
There you still see these attributes.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.030
But if you now find any styles for this component in is yes as follow this component they will actually

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:17.620
get applied globally and I can demonstrate this by going into this C S S file and if I change the label

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.620
color and the label is in the cockpit not in this component to read Yanno you will see the label there

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.470
is overwritten.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.350
Whilst this label of course still has its custom unique attribute it still has a label in the end.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.370
And in this server element component we disable encapsulation.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.530
So there are a selectors aren't changed by Engler.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.790
They don't receive their unique selector therefore they are enforced.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.790
They are used application wide also affecting average components might be the behavior you want.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.700
Chances are that this is not the case but it's important to know that you can change this behavior.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.950
Now besides on yours it could choose native and native users.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.080
The shadow on technology.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.610
This should give you the same result as before with emulated but only in browsers which supported which

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.690
is why for most cases you want to choose emulate it but be aware that you could switch to an on or native

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.520
here too.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.130
So I will go back to emulate it which again you wouldn't have to add as a default anyways with that

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.590
our labels should no longer be read now.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.210
So that is how you can change it and how you encapsulation works.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.960
A nice tool ensuring that by default only your component receives the styles you defined for it.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.170
But as you learned it can be overwritten
