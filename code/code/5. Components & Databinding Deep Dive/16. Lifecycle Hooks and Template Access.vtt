Before concluding this module one more thing related to our hooks here we learned about at view child

00:11.150 --> 00:18.360
which we can use year in the cockpit to get access to elements from our wall dorm from our template.

00:18.680 --> 00:23.320
Let's do the same here and the server element component team of the fall where we have all these lifecycle

00:23.320 --> 00:24.360
hooks.

00:24.380 --> 00:29.360
Let's say I'm one to get access to this heading so I'll simply place a local reference name heading

00:29.360 --> 00:30.000
on it.

00:31.050 --> 00:36.310
Therefore I'll add a new At view child property.

00:36.330 --> 00:40.190
Make sure to import view child from angular core.

00:40.480 --> 00:49.370
And with that at all stored is in the header property which is of type element ref as we learned which

00:49.360 --> 00:53.020
also needs to be imported from angular core.

00:53.060 --> 00:58.910
And I want to select the heading local reference with a just placed on the last day of year.

00:59.570 --> 01:08.140
So after we got access to it and now we would expect that we can't use this before we reached after

01:08.150 --> 01:09.150
due in it.

01:09.350 --> 01:12.120
So let's try it in NZ on it.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.870
Let me actually console log this

01:17.930 --> 01:21.290
header and there is a native element.

01:21.560 --> 01:27.780
And now let's Exel something which is definitely available on a div and that is the text content.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.260
If we do it as and I saved this let's view the console.

01:33.380 --> 01:38.910
If I reload the application here you see this empty line here.

01:39.030 --> 01:45.650
This is where I would expect the text content can make this even clearer by outputting text content.

01:47.160 --> 01:53.130
And then while rendering the text content of the word any There is no text content in here as you can

01:53.130 --> 01:55.660
see an empty space.

01:55.770 --> 02:00.930
If I copy the exact same code and place it as an after view in it here.

02:01.170 --> 02:04.050
So offered the view should have initialized.

02:04.100 --> 02:10.410
Now you will see that here when it is called the second time after viewing it we see a test server.

02:10.700 --> 02:16.430
So that is the difference between wild points of time where it is Hooke's run after viewing it gives

02:16.430 --> 02:19.450
you access to the template elements.

02:19.460 --> 02:22.660
You can then access them and use their values and so on.

02:22.820 --> 02:24.650
Before does hook has been reached.

02:24.740 --> 02:26.060
You can't do that.

02:26.060 --> 02:31.180
You can't check the value of some element in your dorm because it hasn't been rendered yet.
