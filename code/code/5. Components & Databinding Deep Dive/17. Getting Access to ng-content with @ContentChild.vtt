00:02.560 --> 00:08.190
And The Last Lecture we learned that we have viewed child and how we can access it in our lifecycle

00:08.190 --> 00:09.100
hooks.

00:09.150 --> 00:17.850
Now there's one other nice little addition in app component where we add our content which we then project

00:17.910 --> 00:19.720
into our server element.

00:20.070 --> 00:23.810
Let's say we also want to place a local reference on this paragraph.

00:24.060 --> 00:31.950
So the content paragraph maybe but now we want to use that in our service element component which is

00:31.950 --> 00:35.110
where this content will end up in the end.

00:35.130 --> 00:40.590
Now in the app component which is where we currently placed as in the template we could use add view

00:40.590 --> 00:46.350
child because it's in the template of the app component even though it will be kind of passed on to

00:46.350 --> 00:48.670
the server element component later.

00:49.080 --> 00:54.000
Since we know that it will be there it would be nice if we could also access it from the server element

00:54.000 --> 00:59.070
component but at the view child won't work because it's not part of the view.

00:59.130 --> 01:05.340
It's part of the content which is why we also have separate hooks here content in it and viewing it.

01:06.120 --> 01:13.350
Great thing is we don't only have viewed child we also have content child which all needs to be imported

01:13.350 --> 01:15.620
from an English core.

01:15.740 --> 01:22.490
This also allows us to pass a selector so the reference name content paragraph would be the selector

01:22.490 --> 01:30.200
we chose here in the app component HVM of file and then just like with edu child we get.

01:30.210 --> 01:35.570
We can store this in some property which will be of Taieb element ref like this.

01:35.730 --> 01:42.660
And now we can use it and just like with new ref we of course can't access the value or anything before

01:42.660 --> 01:45.480
we reached content in it.

01:45.540 --> 01:52.950
So that is something I just wanted to add at content child to get access to content which is stored

01:52.980 --> 01:57.650
in another component but then passed on via And the content.

01:57.960 --> 02:04.500
Now let me lock this and I will log it here and on in it to demonstrate that it is not there here.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.070
I will simply output text content of paragraph

02:14.690 --> 02:26.400
Boob's paragraph and access this paragraph native element text contemned and then I will copy this to

02:26.520 --> 02:28.880
offer content in it.

02:28.890 --> 02:36.450
Now once I save this and reload the application you'll see that the first time we call it it's empty

02:36.870 --> 02:43.950
here after on in it but thereafter in ngi after content in it or after this has been called once this

02:43.940 --> 02:46.430
hook has been called we see just the tasks.

02:46.440 --> 02:51.310
Now it was initialized data is the missing piece.

02:51.390 --> 02:57.930
Understanding how we can get access to elements in our dorm and how we can work with these lifecycle

02:57.930 --> 02:58.520
hooks
