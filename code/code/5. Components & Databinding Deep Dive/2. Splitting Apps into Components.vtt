WEBVTT

00:02.860 --> 00:06.040
That's a project you can find attached to this lecture here.

00:06.040 --> 00:12.310
It allows us to define a server name here and then some content for the server and then we can either

00:12.310 --> 00:14.680
add a server or a blueprint.

00:14.680 --> 00:20.500
And as you can see both look pretty similar but the server is bold and red has some bold and red text.

00:20.590 --> 00:24.540
The blueprint has it Halik LWT text.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.320
So that's the difference here.

00:26.320 --> 00:30.300
Now this app is all running in one component.

00:30.300 --> 00:35.680
As of now in the app component here in the template we got a lot of code and we can do better we can

00:35.680 --> 00:42.280
split this up because that's not ideal having all that logic in this component here maybe splitting

00:42.280 --> 00:48.810
it up makes sense because that would also allow us if we build a bigger app to reuse parts of that.

00:48.820 --> 00:55.600
So how could we split this up we could create a new component for this whole cockpit here where we enter

00:55.600 --> 00:57.870
a name and content and click the buttons.

00:58.060 --> 01:03.170
And of course we could also create component component for individual server.

01:03.490 --> 01:10.450
And with that we should have a much leaner app component HDMI file and we would bundle our business

01:10.450 --> 01:13.930
logic better into individual components.

01:13.930 --> 01:15.870
Now we learned how to create new components.

01:15.880 --> 01:16.860
I will use to Seelye.

01:16.870 --> 01:23.320
You could of course also do it manually and I will create new components with n g g and then let's say

01:23.320 --> 01:26.320
the first component could be does cockpit here.

01:26.380 --> 01:30.960
So I will simply name it cockpit component.

01:31.090 --> 01:37.620
Now as an addition we can type dash dash spec false to make sure does the Spectre's testing Follett's

01:37.660 --> 01:38.620
not getting created.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.880
I deleted it all the time anyways.

01:41.200 --> 01:47.230
And then I will repeat a step for a number new component which I will simply name server aliments server

01:47.260 --> 01:50.000
element because it could either be a server or a blueprint.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.380
And in this example.

01:51.760 --> 01:55.040
So if we get to new folders in our app component.

01:55.300 --> 01:56.900
So two new components.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.220
Thus far nothing you don't know.

01:59.260 --> 02:05.430
Now we can of course take our code here from the component age female file from this template.

02:05.440 --> 02:13.750
So for example this first bootstrap row here caddied a year and added to our cockpit like this.

02:13.750 --> 02:20.870
Now of course if we remove the template part here we also have to remove or we have to move the Moffats

02:20.880 --> 02:21.910
we're calling here.

02:21.910 --> 02:24.890
So on ad server and on at blueprint.

02:25.180 --> 02:32.230
So in the typescript code here I will copy both will cut both elements here and move them over to our

02:32.230 --> 02:36.010
cockpit and will soon also come to engine in it.

02:36.010 --> 02:44.530
And what this does as a side note now of course my issue is that I try to portion is to raise or to

02:44.620 --> 02:46.470
an array which doesn't exist here.

02:46.480 --> 02:50.230
Server elements that array is still in the app component.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.330
We could of course move that.

02:52.410 --> 03:00.210
Oh and maybe I should also move that closing colleague braes we could of course move those server elements

03:00.210 --> 03:00.900
array.

03:01.200 --> 03:07.530
But then we would no longer have it in our app component and we will need a dare to you though because

03:07.590 --> 03:14.330
there we still will need to replicate the server elements to create the well service we output here.

03:14.330 --> 03:20.580
So as a first step what I can move of course cut and paste are the two properties which are used Year

03:20.580 --> 03:23.990
with a binding so they can move that to the cockpit.

03:24.120 --> 03:28.450
But we will have to see what we do about these server elements.

03:28.800 --> 03:33.630
For now let's go back to DIAK component HVM file and take a single server here.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.770
So this panel.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.730
Day of year.

03:35.940 --> 03:42.210
So with that all we have here now is the row in the column and the other part will go into the HTL file

03:42.210 --> 03:46.290
of the server element because that is a single server.

03:46.290 --> 03:51.880
Now here of course we have this loop and that's not what I want to have in years.

03:51.880 --> 03:57.980
I will get rid of it there because I still want to manage my array of server elements in the app component

03:58.470 --> 04:03.980
because we somehow need to be able to manipulate it from the cockpit and then replicated in the app

04:03.990 --> 04:09.930
component to create multiple instances of this server element component which is only a single server.

04:09.930 --> 04:12.890
Keep this in mind this is not the list of service.

04:12.930 --> 04:17.130
Of course you could set this up differently but this is the approach I will go with and this approach

04:17.130 --> 04:18.810
won't work right now.

04:18.840 --> 04:26.250
We also tried to Xosa element properties now inside of our server element component which we also don't

04:26.250 --> 04:26.990
have.

04:27.390 --> 04:29.700
So a couple of things to fix.

04:29.700 --> 04:37.800
I like the general way we split up our app and that we now can add our app cockpit here where we before

04:37.810 --> 04:44.860
had the full HVM Alico we moved over there and that we can add our app server element component here

04:45.270 --> 04:52.460
and that we could also replicate this with Angie for lead server element of server elements.

04:52.560 --> 04:57.290
So we can of course all the place and G-4 on a component as you already learned before.

04:57.300 --> 05:03.750
So I like dad but I don't like that the app is broken and if we have a look at it that well we simply

05:03.750 --> 05:06.330
get an error that a couple of properties are unknown.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.910
So we somehow.

05:08.070 --> 05:09.640
And that is a key part.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.360
Need to get a new server.

05:12.360 --> 05:17.500
We add in the cockpit to this array of service in our app component.

05:17.580 --> 05:24.990
So we kind of need to inform our app component that one of its child components the app cockpit changed

05:24.990 --> 05:27.650
or that something changed there to which we should react.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.230
And you sir was added.

05:29.820 --> 05:33.330
And then we also need to get the data we got from the cockpit.

05:33.330 --> 05:38.620
So this news server which is managed has an array of service in the app component we need to get to

05:38.620 --> 05:44.990
individual server of a single loop iteration here down to the app server element.

05:45.090 --> 05:50.310
So we need to pass data between components and that of course is a super important task.

05:50.310 --> 05:53.910
We haven't touched yet but we will dive deeper into right now.
