WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:03.770
So we add navigation.

00:03.770 --> 00:05.090
The last section.

00:05.090 --> 00:11.090
Now I want to work on this list of recipe right now if we have a look at its component here.

00:11.150 --> 00:16.440
We see that the code for a single list item is this one here.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.580
We do have a separate recipe item component.

00:19.580 --> 00:25.790
But right now it doesn't hold any template because we had to outsource this code and put it into this

00:25.850 --> 00:31.010
recipe list component temporarily because otherwise it would not have been able to display our recipe

00:31.010 --> 00:32.090
data.

00:32.090 --> 00:39.890
Now we know how to pass data to a component though so we can cut all that code here and put it into

00:39.890 --> 00:42.860
the recipe item component template.

00:42.860 --> 00:49.220
Now the goal of course is to get this energy for loop here and remove it from inside the item and move

00:49.220 --> 00:57.620
it back on the item here and then pass down the individual item the individual recipe of each iteration

00:58.310 --> 01:04.000
to that component so that we can still output recipe name and so on here.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.150
So that is your chance to do this on your own again.

01:07.410 --> 01:11.850
The video and try to loop through the component itself.

01:11.900 --> 01:18.530
So get Engy 4 out of this component and then pass down the selected recipe for the recipe of the current

01:18.530 --> 01:25.360
loop iteration in a few seconds you'll see my solution.

01:25.380 --> 01:27.340
So where are you successful.

01:27.360 --> 01:35.010
First of all I'll cut DNG for loop here and I'll go back to the recipe list component and added to the

01:35.150 --> 01:37.010
Abb recipe item selector.

01:37.170 --> 01:41.760
So that now the whole component is replicated for each recipe.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.970
Now the issue of course is that we don't have the recipe which we access inside the recipe item component

01:47.970 --> 01:48.820
anymore.

01:49.320 --> 01:57.260
So we should probably add a recipe here the recipe of that single recipe item component.

01:57.540 --> 02:00.110
It will be of type recipes of course.

02:00.270 --> 02:07.410
So we have to import this from our own recipe model going up to folders and then it's there right in

02:07.410 --> 02:10.270
the full Are we well and moved to.

02:10.770 --> 02:13.700
And initially this will not be defined.

02:13.770 --> 02:21.230
There won't be a value assigned to it because I want to get this recipe from outside.

02:21.550 --> 02:25.940
So you get a recipe from outside or any data from outside.

02:25.990 --> 02:34.510
We need to add something a decorator at input with parentheses which needs to be imported from an angle

02:34.540 --> 02:41.920
or core add input allows us to bind this component property from outside.

02:41.980 --> 02:46.500
And of course I want to binded from my recipe list component here.

02:46.630 --> 02:52.590
So in this list where I replicate the single recipe item a couple of times.

02:52.870 --> 03:02.620
Now here we can now blind to our recipe referring to the property in a single recipe item and find the

03:02.620 --> 03:04.770
recipe of the current Lupa iteration.

03:05.080 --> 03:09.310
Now I'm not happy with the naming here because that can be very confusing.

03:09.340 --> 03:11.680
We're having recipe fried times here.

03:11.980 --> 03:20.080
So to make super clear what each name here refers to I'll rename the recipe here in our loob to recipe

03:20.170 --> 03:26.470
L for element and that also has to be replaced here then because we're passing the single recipe element

03:26.500 --> 03:27.480
as a value.

03:27.500 --> 03:33.040
Therefore on the right side of the equal sign tudy pineapple recipe property.

03:33.490 --> 03:40.270
And keep in mind the recipe here between the square brackets simply is the recipe property in the component

03:40.830 --> 03:42.310
we're placing us on.

03:42.310 --> 03:47.850
So in the recipe item component desert recipe here that is what that refers to.

03:48.050 --> 03:55.540
And actually to make this super super clear I can split this horizontally so you have the receiving

03:55.540 --> 03:56.200
component.

03:56.200 --> 04:02.110
The recipe item component and to sending one year template of the sending one the rest of the list component

04:02.110 --> 04:03.220
above each other.

04:03.220 --> 04:05.970
So that is what we're binding to here.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.950
So let me close this with this.

04:08.950 --> 04:13.760
If we save that we should see the same as before which makes sense.

04:13.760 --> 04:18.590
It's a good thing that we see this it means it didn't break and it makes sense because now we're successfully

04:18.590 --> 04:25.680
passing down the data which keep in mind is stored in the recipe list component here in disarray.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.800
We're successfully passing this down to the recipe item component.

04:30.800 --> 04:37.070
Now let's work on the feature that once we click item here we actually select it and then we load it

04:37.340 --> 04:39.340
in the recipe detail component.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.800
So that is what we'll work on next.
