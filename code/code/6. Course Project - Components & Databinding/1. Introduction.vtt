So now that you'll learn more about components and data binding and especially how you can communicate

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.820
between your components and how lifecycle books work and so on.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.350
You gained a lot of new knowledge which is super important for most projects are going to build including

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.170
our course project.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.960
So in this section what we're going to do is we're going to find you and yes we're going to make sure

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.510

And generally that we have a working communication between our components.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.180
So let's dive into this
