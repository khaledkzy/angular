00:02.310 --> 00:05.850
In this course we had a closer look at observables.

00:06.050 --> 00:12.830
And with that knowledge about observables I now want to do some cleanup work in my app here.

00:12.830 --> 00:18.950
First of all in the recipe service I want to remove my recipes select that event emitter here because

00:18.950 --> 00:20.580
we're not using data anymore.

00:20.660 --> 00:22.540
So we can't simply delete that here.

00:22.580 --> 00:25.730
We changed the way we select our recipes.

00:25.730 --> 00:33.920
Now with that changed we can also go to the recipes component and remove our subscription here because

00:33.920 --> 00:35.690
again we're not using this anymore.

00:35.690 --> 00:41.700
We can also get rid of the selected recipe therefore and get rid of the import of recipe model.

00:41.710 --> 00:47.990
Also get rid of our injector service You're not get rid of the recipe service though because we're also

00:47.990 --> 00:50.380
setting it up in the provider's array.

00:50.570 --> 00:51.740
Any similar code.

00:51.740 --> 00:53.580
We don't need to clean up anything else.

00:53.750 --> 00:59.900
But there was only one thing I also want to use an observable to improve our shopping lists service

01:00.300 --> 01:00.980
here.

01:01.010 --> 01:07.900
We are right now using an event emitter to inform our components about changes that is OK.

01:07.910 --> 01:15.890
But a better practice is to use a subject subject needs to be imported from our exchanges subject and

01:15.890 --> 01:18.510
then we can remove Debe anti-Mitt or import.

01:18.920 --> 01:26.230
And with that we only need to apply some tiny changes to our code here when we called emit.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.430
We now need to call next.

01:28.460 --> 01:34.760
But then we still pass to evaluate any subject still is a generic type so that should still work the

01:34.760 --> 01:36.330
same down here of course.

01:36.470 --> 01:38.360
So replace it with next.

01:38.370 --> 01:42.770
Now in the places where we listened to these changes.

01:43.010 --> 01:47.990
Well that still works because we still have to subscribe functioned air which works just like it worked

01:47.990 --> 01:49.680
on U-bend emitter.

01:50.120 --> 01:58.010
Now here's something important though we do subscribe to our own subject here now for dead angler won't

01:58.010 --> 02:00.080
handle our subscription.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.790
So here we should unsubscribe manually.

02:02.990 --> 02:06.810
So let's do this by adding our subscription year.

02:06.890 --> 02:13.430
Maybe a private property subscription which is of type subscription subscription has to be imported

02:13.430 --> 02:17.020
from our Yes slash subscription here.

02:17.510 --> 02:18.960
Let's move it to the top here.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.300
To have it Melodia angler imports.

02:21.680 --> 02:29.330
And with that property created I can assign these scriptures setting up an NGO and in it to it here

02:29.420 --> 02:32.330
in and join in it as as as I just said.

02:32.330 --> 02:40.250
So now I will also implement on Destroy here make sure to imported from an angle or a core and that

02:40.250 --> 02:44.430
requires me to implement Engy on the stroy in here.

02:44.540 --> 02:51.920
I now want to unsubscribe and that is important to prevent any memory leaks because since we are using

02:52.010 --> 02:59.150
our own subject here we want to make sure that we correctly unsubscribe Whenever we don't need it anymore.

02:59.160 --> 03:04.700
So with this saved we can actually try to us in our app by clicking around and just trying some things

03:04.700 --> 03:05.420
here.

03:05.420 --> 03:06.970
That all seems to work.

03:06.970 --> 03:08.450
Shopping list seems to work.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.690
Let's add Brad here so that still updates.

03:11.700 --> 03:17.420
So our subject still works like event emitter but now it's a little bit of a better practice.

03:17.420 --> 03:21.920
The remaining cleanup work I want to do for now is in the hetero component.

03:21.980 --> 03:28.950
When we clicked the recipe book Grandier I want to remove the ref element and instead also use router

03:29.060 --> 03:35.430
link and redirect to route page which of course then the bull redirects to slash recipes.

03:35.630 --> 03:39.760
So with that in place now we have a working app in the state.

03:39.770 --> 03:41.600
I want to have it right now.

03:41.840 --> 03:47.690
With that we can continue to add a form section and learn more about forms and then add them to the

03:47.690 --> 03:49.400
recipe book in the future to
