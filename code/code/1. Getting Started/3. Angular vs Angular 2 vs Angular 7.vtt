00:02.340 --> 00:04.630
So we now learned what angle is.

00:04.740 --> 00:10.850
Maybe you also came across the many words of angular that you can find there is angular A7 now.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.440
We also had six.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.950
Couple of words to an angular one.

00:16.080 --> 00:23.880
Now angular one was initially released in 2010 and it provided a revolution to the way we can build

00:23.970 --> 00:29.930
front end user interfaces in the browser because it was a huge step forward.

00:29.940 --> 00:37.200
When it came to using browser side javascript to reach rendered a Dom to update the dom at runtime and

00:37.200 --> 00:44.310
therefore provide highly interactive user experiences without reloading the page angular or was a complete

00:44.310 --> 00:49.300
rewrite of Angler one an angle or two was initially released in 2016.

00:49.320 --> 00:54.570
It has nothing in common with angular one except for the core team that developed it.

00:54.810 --> 01:00.250
And therefore if you know angular one unfortunately that knowledge will not help you much.

01:00.300 --> 01:05.350
On the other hand you also don't need to know angular one to get the most out of discourse.

01:05.580 --> 01:09.750
Now what's up with angler's six seven and all yabber versions.

01:09.750 --> 01:14.750
Now this entire set on the left here is now referred to as just angular.

01:14.790 --> 01:20.250
It's one in the same framework which totally differs from angular one but which doesn't not differ a

01:20.250 --> 01:22.180
lot within the separate world.

01:22.260 --> 01:28.860
So it is just angular on the hand angular one is now called angular J.S. to make it clear that these

01:28.860 --> 01:32.470
are two totally separate frameworks now two different words.

01:32.490 --> 01:38.910
We have four angular So four angular two plus are really just incremental improvements.

01:38.910 --> 01:40.500
No complete rewrites.

01:40.500 --> 01:46.590
Not at all to certain texts we use an angle or 7 and therefore in discourse is the same as we used an

01:46.590 --> 01:47.580
angle or two.

01:47.610 --> 01:55.590
There were just some bug fixes minor improvements some new features but generally decent access to same

01:56.170 --> 02:02.900
discourse was updated a couple of times to incorporate these changes and you'll learn the latest angular

02:02.910 --> 02:04.080
syntax in this course.

02:04.080 --> 02:10.040
Therefore because I always and I will do that in the future do update lectures or whole sections or

02:10.050 --> 02:14.010
the whole course even if it is required to meet the latest syntax.

02:14.100 --> 02:22.140
But again it hasn't changed a lot almost hasn't changed at all since angular to an angler JSH or one

02:22.140 --> 02:26.060
as I mentioned is not related to angle or two and it's not part of discourse.

02:26.100 --> 02:30.870
We focus on this part on angler and you'll learn later syntax in this course.

02:30.930 --> 02:35.480
You'll learn Anglo's 7 here but behind the scenes you also learn angler too.

02:35.490 --> 02:41.000
Because again it's really just the same just that angular sevenths like improved to work.

02:41.100 --> 02:41.920
Of angular to.
