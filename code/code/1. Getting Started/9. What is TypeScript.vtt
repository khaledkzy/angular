We're about to get started soon,

1
00:04.740 --> 00:07.860
but I did mention that we're going to use Typescript in this course.

2
00:07.860 --> 00:14.850
We already did use it when we changed the first app. What is Typescript? Typescript, really is just a superset

3
00:14.910 --> 00:15.770
of JavaScript.

4
00:15.810 --> 00:21.750
It offers more features than vanilla JavaScript, like classes, interfaces and, very important, which

5
00:21.840 --> 00:24.850
gives it the name, types; strong typing.

6
00:24.870 --> 00:30.030
So, you define in Typescript if a certain variable is a number, a string or something else.

7
00:30.060 --> 00:31.960
You don't do this in vanilla JavaScript.

8
00:31.980 --> 00:33.720
There, you have dynamic typing.

9
00:33.750 --> 00:38.390
You can have a string variable and then you can assign a number and that's totally fine.

10
00:38.400 --> 00:39.790
That won't work in Typescript.

11
00:39.810 --> 00:45.270
It will give you an error and therefore it allows you to write much more robust code which gets checked

12
00:45.330 --> 00:46.560
at the time you write it;

13
00:46.680 --> 00:48.460
and not just at the time you run it. This is

14
00:48.520 --> 00:50.300
a great enhancement.

15
00:50.760 --> 00:55.610
However, Typescript doesn't run in the browser, so it is compiled to JavaScript in the end.

16
00:55.650 --> 01:01.050
This compilation is handled by the CLI; one of the reasons why we need the CLI, why we need a

17
01:01.050 --> 01:03.960
project management tool like the CLI.

18
01:03.960 --> 01:09.480
Now, this compilation is really fast and therefore, in the end, in the browser JavaScript is going to run.

19
01:09.480 --> 01:14.780
We're not writing the Angular app in JavaScript though because, whilst technically possible,

20
01:14.880 --> 01:16.600
that wouldn't be much fun.

21
01:16.680 --> 01:23.820
A lot of the features really only exist in Typescript and Angular is meant to be used together with Typescript.

22
01:23.820 --> 01:26.190
That being said, you don't have to learn Typescript

23
01:26.190 --> 01:27.160
for this course.

24
01:27.210 --> 01:29.720
You should be able to pick it up along the way.

25
01:29.850 --> 01:35.460
I do have a whole section giving a brief introduction into Typescript at the end of this course,

26
01:35.640 --> 01:37.200
so feel free to jump ahead.

27
01:37.230 --> 01:39.950
Go through that section right now if you feel like you need it

28
01:39.960 --> 01:45.300
or, throughout the course if you feel like you need some deeper dive into some of the features you see

29
01:45.300 --> 01:47.080
there and you should be fine,

30
01:47.100 --> 01:49.400
you should be able to follow along just fine.

31
01:49.440 --> 01:55.350
Of course, if you feel like it, feel free to pick up another course or tutorial focused on Typescript so that

32
01:55.350 --> 01:56.610
you have something to look at

33
01:56.610 --> 02:03.000
if something is unclear in this course. Generally though, Typescript is an addition to JavaScript; not

34
02:03.000 --> 02:04.290
a complete replacement,

35
02:04.290 --> 02:07.180
so a lot of the commands will look really familiar.
