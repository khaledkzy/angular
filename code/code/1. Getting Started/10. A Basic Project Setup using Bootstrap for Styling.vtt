Throughout this course, I'll often start with an empty project for a given section so that we can focus on the topic

1
00:08.810 --> 00:09.240
at hand

2
00:09.260 --> 00:10.760
in that section.

3
00:10.760 --> 00:15.560
So therefore, you can simply create a new project with ng new; as we did a couple of lectures

4
00:15.560 --> 00:22.070
ago and I'll typically start with an empty app.component.html file. If I have a different starting

5
00:22.130 --> 00:24.440
setup, you'll find it attached to the lectures.

6
00:24.440 --> 00:27.090
I'll always ensure that this is the case.

7
00:27.380 --> 00:31.100
But here, I'll now simply have this empty setup.

8
00:31.190 --> 00:37.730
We can remove FormsModule from app.module.ts (in case you added it) so that we have a clean

9
00:37.730 --> 00:44.120
starting project and there's one important thing: in this course, I'll use the Bootstrap CSS framework

10
00:44.210 --> 00:50.780
to have some nice CSS styles out-of-the-box without us having to write all these CSS styles. Now,

11
00:50.780 --> 00:56.540
to add this, we need to install it; we need to download it. We can do this by quitting this development server

12
00:56.830 --> 01:00.800
with Ctrl-C and then installing it with this NPM tool

13
01:00.860 --> 01:10.590
(the Node Package Manager), by running npm install --save bootstrap@3. It's important

14
01:10.770 --> 01:14.490
to install version 3 as it's the version I use in this course.

15
01:14.490 --> 01:19.780
Now, this will install it locally in this project; not globally, but locally.

16
01:19.860 --> 01:26.280
Simply hit Enter and it will download Bootstrap and store it in the node_modules folder.

17
01:26.280 --> 01:28.160
Now, that's the first step,

18
01:28.320 --> 01:34.770
but to be able to use it, we also need to make Angular aware of this styling package we want to use and

19
01:34.770 --> 01:37.170
we do that in one of the config files

20
01:37.170 --> 01:43.530
(the most important one actually) the angular.json file. This configures the CLI project. We will not

21
01:43.530 --> 01:48.120
work in this project file throughout the course because the default setup is perfect and we don't need

22
01:48.120 --> 01:49.390
to change anything there.

23
01:49.650 --> 01:54.780
But one thing we do need to change right now is the styles we want to use by default.

24
01:54.780 --> 01:59.730
Here you've got this "styles" array in this "architect", "build" node.

25
02:00.030 --> 02:01.830
Now, it already has one entry

26
02:01.870 --> 02:04.350
"src/styles.css".

27
02:04.350 --> 02:09.080
This is a file you can use to define some global styles you want to use application-wide.

28
02:09.120 --> 02:15.510
So, you can enter any code here and it will be used in every Angular component. But, in my case, I will add

29
02:15.510 --> 02:16.440
another import

30
02:16.530 --> 02:23.040
prior to that "src/styles.css" import so that we could overwrite it within this file.

31
02:23.220 --> 02:26.300
Now, here we need to point to node_modules

32
02:26.430 --> 02:28.170
(to this node_modules folder

33
02:28.170 --> 02:34.260
we've got here) and if you scroll down a bit, there are many dependencies because you have dependencies

34
02:34.260 --> 02:35.600
of dependencies here.

35
02:35.820 --> 02:42.800
If you scroll down a bit more, you'll see bootstrap and in there you'll find a dist folder, a CSS folder and

36
02:42.800 --> 02:45.180
there, bootstrap.css file,

37
02:45.260 --> 02:52.850
or to be precise, there is also a bootstrap.min.css file just hidden a bit by my IDE. So, we can enter

38
02:52.960 --> 03:04.350
"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" and make sure that

39
03:04.370 --> 03:05.880
you've got no typo in here.   

40
03:05.900 --> 03:08.390
It's easy to miss the 't' or something like that.

41
03:08.420 --> 03:11.060
So, make sure that you have a path like this.

42
03:12.690 --> 03:19.080
Once you've added this path, save your angular.json file and re-run ng serve to load this

43
03:19.080 --> 03:20.330
new configuration.

44
03:20.340 --> 03:22.990
As I said, you don't really need to change anything else in here.

45
03:23.040 --> 03:25.370
The default configuration should work perfectly.

46
03:26.320 --> 03:33.010
So, once you're done you can visit localhost:4200. You won't see anything because I deleted all the

47
03:33.010 --> 03:34.930
content in the template.

48
03:35.230 --> 03:41.740
But if you access the Elements tab in the Developer Tools, you should see that in the head section there

49
03:41.740 --> 03:47.810
are two styles imports and the first one should be Bootstrap v3.3.7.

50
03:47.860 --> 03:53.930
Now, this is the import you need there and with that, everything we do in the course will look correct.

51
03:53.930 --> 03:56.150
Now, one last change is needed in app.component.ts.

52
03:56.150 --> 04:02.440
I'll get rid of whichever property we have here. With that, the starting project is prepared. You can always

53
04:02.440 --> 04:08.700
use this at the beginning of a new module and, importantly, you also saw how you can add your own styles.
