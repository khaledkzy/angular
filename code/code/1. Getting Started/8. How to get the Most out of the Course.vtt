Now that we've had a look at what this course offers,

1
00:05.030 --> 00:07.940
let me explain to you how you can get the most out of it.

2
00:07.940 --> 00:14.570
Of course, you should watch the videos, go through the lectures and I do my best there to explain how Angular

3
00:14.570 --> 00:18.550
works, why it works like this and how you use the different features together.

4
00:18.860 --> 00:25.250
Besides the lectures, I've got a couple of assignments in this course, practices, exercises and I urge

5
00:25.250 --> 00:27.110
you to do these exercises.

6
00:27.200 --> 00:29.840
I designed them to be challenging but doable

7
00:30.050 --> 00:35.290
These assignments allow you to check if you understood a certain concept and to really practice

8
00:35.290 --> 00:38.130
it and get more comfortable using it.

9
00:38.480 --> 00:44.990
Well besides the assignments, we're going to build a whole course project and I can only invite you to

10
00:45.010 --> 00:46.580
build this project with me

11
00:46.670 --> 00:53.210
and also sometimes pause the video and build a feature we're about to implement together, on your own first.

12
00:53.210 --> 00:55.240
This really is a great exercise

13
00:55.240 --> 01:01.520
too and it might also be very interesting for you to expand this course project beyond the things we build here

14
01:01.580 --> 01:03.620
to add new features to it.

15
01:04.100 --> 01:10.280
If you get stuck somewhere or if something is unclear, there is the Q&A Section and I'm very

16
01:10.280 --> 01:14.980
happy to help you there and answer any questions you might have related to this course.

17
01:14.990 --> 01:22.910
However, you will learn even more if you not only ask, but if you answer. Dig through the Q&A Section

18
01:23.030 --> 01:25.480
and try to help other students too.

19
01:25.520 --> 01:26.430
Why?

20
01:26.690 --> 01:32.640
Because by answering, you are really challenged to think about a problem and come up with a solution.

21
01:32.900 --> 01:36.390
It doesn't really matter if that is then the best possible solution.

22
01:36.590 --> 01:41.150
If there is a better one, someone else is going to correct you and then you'll learn again.

23
01:41.360 --> 01:47.750
But, by thinking about it in the first place, you really go through the concepts you learned and you apply

24
01:47.750 --> 01:49.470
them to a real problem.

25
01:49.480 --> 01:52.630
So, that's how you will learn the most.

26
01:52.640 --> 01:57.260
Besides that, however strange it might sound, the official documentation

27
01:57.260 --> 02:03.410
and Google are your friends; especially if you get some strange error messages. Simply Google for it and

28
02:03.470 --> 02:06.280
not because I'm too lazy to help you, I will help you,

29
02:06.410 --> 02:10.970
but because it's so much faster than waiting for my reply or for the reply of someone else.

30
02:11.060 --> 02:14.760
Most of the error messages were encountered by other people before too,

31
02:14.780 --> 02:20.630
so chances are great that you'll get an answer by simply searching for it. By following this advice,

32
02:20.720 --> 02:23.710
you should learn a lot about Angular in this course.
