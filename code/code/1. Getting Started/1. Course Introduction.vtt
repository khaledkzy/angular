Welcome to my Complete Guide on Angular. It's so great to have you on board. In this course, you're going to

1
00:08.170 --> 00:14.810
learn what Angular is and how you can use it to build awesome front-end web applications with it; very

2
00:14.860 --> 00:21.360
reactive web applications with great user experiences. For that, throughout this course number 3 for testing

3
00:21.460 --> 00:26.980
you're going to learn all the individual building blocks which make up Angular before we then also dive

4
00:26.980 --> 00:29.560
into the more advanced features.

5
00:29.620 --> 00:35.350
And we're going to build a project throughout the course putting all these things you learn in theory (kind

6
00:35.350 --> 00:41.350
of) and which you practice from the course into the perspective of a real project, so that you can see

7
00:41.470 --> 00:42.910
how you would apply them there

8
00:42.940 --> 00:48.390
and that you can see how you build up real web applications with the things you learn here.

9
00:48.730 --> 00:53.820
So with that, I'd say let's dive into it and let's dive into the most important question first.

10
00:53.890 --> 00:55.330
What is Angular?
