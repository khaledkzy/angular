In the last lecture we learned about that hierarchical injector.

00:06.600 --> 00:11.560
And actually this injection behavior leads to the behavior we see here.

00:11.580 --> 00:13.760
Now that's not a bug that's intended.

00:13.890 --> 00:19.860
You might have an application where you want to have many different instances of the same service where

00:19.860 --> 00:25.950
you absolutely don't want to have the same instance but sometimes you want to have the same instance.

00:25.950 --> 00:32.630
And we definitely do because right now for our account service we have three instances.

00:32.670 --> 00:35.750
The first one gets created here in app component.

00:35.880 --> 00:41.190
We provide a tier app component receives its own service or it's an instance of the service I should

00:41.190 --> 00:44.270
say as to all the child components.

00:44.280 --> 00:50.460
Now you might say fine because new account and account are child components right but they are provided

00:50.460 --> 00:55.070
again and hence we override the instance we would get from the app component.

00:55.350 --> 01:00.060
Now a new account and accounts are a component have their own incenses.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.370
So these are average two instances of this service class.

01:03.780 --> 01:10.680
And therefore if we add a new service we call ad account there we push it on this array of accounts.

01:10.740 --> 01:15.930
And this actually works but it's a totally different instance of the service that we won than the one

01:15.930 --> 01:17.430
we use here in app component.

01:17.430 --> 01:24.060
The one through which we loop How can we fix it then here for our app simple we just remove it from

01:24.060 --> 01:25.470
the provider's array.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.570
Don't remove it from the constructor.

01:27.570 --> 01:33.840
We of course do need it here because debt Tellez angular that we want an instance the provider's array

01:33.840 --> 01:37.120
basically tells of which instance of where we needed to remove it.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.010
And the same for account component.

01:39.120 --> 01:45.060
Leave it in the constructor leave the import at the top but remove it from the provider's array with

01:45.060 --> 01:46.260
that little change.

01:46.260 --> 01:51.970
If you go back to the application after saving it let's add another account.

01:52.020 --> 01:53.910
Now you'll see it at the bottom.

01:53.910 --> 01:56.650
Now you can change the status again.

01:56.730 --> 01:58.410
So this is the difference.

01:58.590 --> 02:01.680
Different instances of the service.

02:01.680 --> 02:05.520
Now we're using one of the same Before we weren't both.

02:05.530 --> 02:07.390
Maybe the behavior you want in your app.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.970
But make sure that you get the correct one
