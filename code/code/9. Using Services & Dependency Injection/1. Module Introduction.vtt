Welcome to a new module in this course this module is about services and dependency injection.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.030
Now what is that.

00:12.420 --> 00:14.190
Let's start with services.

00:14.190 --> 00:21.450
What are services let's consider does application get an app component and about component and user

00:21.450 --> 00:24.810
component and a user detail component.

00:24.810 --> 00:28.400
Now we might have some math that's in those components.

00:28.620 --> 00:34.730
Let's say we want to log some data to the console and the about component end user detail component.

00:34.740 --> 00:37.800
And somehow this last statement is pretty similar.

00:37.800 --> 00:44.130
So pretty much the same text so we're basically repeating ourselves over duplicating code in two different

00:44.130 --> 00:45.420
components.

00:45.870 --> 00:53.280
Let's say any user component we also want to access some data some array of users maybe and maybe we

00:53.370 --> 00:58.590
also don't know if we will later use it in some other part of our application.

00:58.590 --> 01:08.190
Both use cases duplication of code and data storage providing data are typical use cases for a service

01:08.250 --> 01:15.180
because a service is basically just a number piece and your annual trip another class you can add which

01:15.180 --> 01:22.350
acts as a central repository as a central business unit you can say something where you can store where

01:22.350 --> 01:28.850
you can centralize your code in so we could create a log service for example to centralize our logs

01:28.850 --> 01:30.120
statement.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.790
We could create a user service to manage the data storage here.

01:33.870 --> 01:37.850
Let's see this in a real app so that it becomes more clear though.
