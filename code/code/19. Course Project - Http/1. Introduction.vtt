Back AM to our recipe book and the last course section relearned how we can use age to deepen our angular

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.290
app and therefore how we can reach out to a back end and connect it to our or app.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.750
Well our Engler app here is looking quite good.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.330
But one thing it doesn't offer right now is persistence.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.500
If we added this recipe and let's say remove one of the ingredients like that and we save this we do

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.090
keep this state in our application so we can navigate around and do whatever we want.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.930
But as soon as we reload the page Well we of course reload our web application and there for all we

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.630
have to work with are our dummy recipes the ones we set up here and the recipe service.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.990
So that is one fundamental flaw or problem in our application.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.070
We're not able to store the data the user entered.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.890
And that is why we have to stropped on here at the top safe data and fetch data should allow us to reach

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.120
out to a back end to a server where data will then be Everest's saved in a database or well fetched

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.110
from there.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.680
So that's the exact purpose of these two buttons.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.010
Let's connect them with a back end to make them work.
