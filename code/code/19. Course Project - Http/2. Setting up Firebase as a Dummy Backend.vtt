00:02.530 --> 00:08.740
For this section we're going to use firebase as a bag and not because angular wouldn't work with any

00:08.740 --> 00:14.640
of our back and indeed you may use any bag you like as long as you can connect to it with Anglo's HTP

00:14.670 --> 00:15.250
service.

00:15.250 --> 00:21.640
So as long as you can send requests to certain API endpoints off your back end but because firebase

00:21.640 --> 00:27.160
is so easy to set up and since this course is not about creating the back end which would of course

00:27.160 --> 00:30.260
involve writing a lot of code on the basket itself.

00:30.430 --> 00:36.230
It's great to have a solution like firebase which makes it very easy for us to simulate the angle or

00:36.230 --> 00:38.980
a part of this connection.

00:39.280 --> 00:45.520
So for this I will go to the fire based on Google dot com page and there to the console which allows

00:45.520 --> 00:48.160
us to create new firebase projects.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.300
That is exactly what I want to do.

00:50.410 --> 00:55.840
I will create a new project here and I will name it N-G recipe book.

00:55.900 --> 01:03.490
Any name you like now you're old and pick my location and had to create project to create this new project.

01:03.580 --> 01:09.360
That pretty much is the same step as in the HD P.S. shown earlier in this course.

01:09.490 --> 01:14.670
Now this will take a couple of seconds and once it is finished it will take us to the dashboard.

01:16.600 --> 01:21.090
On the dashboard here we can use firebase in all its glory.

01:21.130 --> 01:27.560
And if you want to use firebase for your protection app definitely dive into the firebase documentation.

01:27.580 --> 01:35.470
For now we will only use the database feature year which as all as shown in the HP section allows us

01:35.470 --> 01:41.130
to simply send requests to diss you or else here and then store data well in the database.

01:41.170 --> 01:48.130
In the firebase database important for this to work we need to adjust the rules so that everyone is

01:48.220 --> 01:50.790
able to write and read data.

01:51.040 --> 01:56.530
And that is something you will then again revisit in your vindication section when we will also learn

01:56.530 --> 02:00.550
how we could enforce authentication in an angular app..

02:00.670 --> 02:02.700
But for now this is what we'll do.

02:02.980 --> 02:07.170
So let's publish these rules so that everyone is able to access our database.

02:07.180 --> 02:10.380
Of course not the settings you want to use in your protection.

02:10.420 --> 02:15.970
Probably And with that dessous the link We're going to use to connect to our back end.

02:16.080 --> 02:23.810
So let's start connecting to it in the next section and let's actually start by saving our recipes there.

02:23.980 --> 02:26.550
Now definitely go ahead and try this on your own.

02:26.590 --> 02:32.980
You'll learn how you can send post requests which sounds like the right tool here too.

02:33.070 --> 02:36.610
Any back end including firebase India HTP S..

02:36.790 --> 02:39.200
So you might want to send such a request.

02:39.230 --> 02:46.900
Q You are L and then an appropriate note to store your data in and then hopefully have your data on

02:46.900 --> 02:47.430
the server.

02:47.470 --> 02:49.390
So go ahead with this.

02:49.390 --> 02:52.080
We'll do this together in the next lecture.
