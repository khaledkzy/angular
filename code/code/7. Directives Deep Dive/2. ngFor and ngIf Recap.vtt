I prepared a little project with you as always can find attached to this lecture here.

00:06.880 --> 00:08.720
And it's a super simple project.

00:08.770 --> 00:10.960
We get a button where we can talk.

00:10.980 --> 00:15.940
You only see odd numbers but right now we don't see any numbers because of us.

00:15.980 --> 00:19.990
Do have an array of numbers here in my app component typescript file.

00:20.140 --> 00:21.440
I'm not outputting it here.

00:21.550 --> 00:24.160
However I did set up a list.

00:24.330 --> 00:25.170
So with this.

00:25.170 --> 00:29.740
Why don't we go ahead and simply add Engy forward with a Stars.

00:29.740 --> 00:37.590
And so is a structural directive tulis list item and then we could simply say let a number of numbers.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.730
We already learned this syntax and you could also extract the index if we wanted but we don't need that

00:42.730 --> 00:43.960
here.

00:44.080 --> 00:51.280
So that is our single number and that of course allows it to now output and here we can output it anywhere

00:51.340 --> 00:54.560
inside is element we placed Engy four on.

00:54.580 --> 01:01.060
So on any nested elements too with that were outputting the number and now we see one two three four

01:01.060 --> 01:09.220
five the button still doesn't do anything though so the reason for this is that well right now we do

01:09.220 --> 01:10.340
something up on clicking.

01:10.360 --> 01:15.730
We said only OT which is this property to what it currently is not.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.620
So if it was faulty set it to True and the other way around.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.230
But we're not using this information.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.870
Let's use it.

01:22.870 --> 01:26.370
Now we could try placing NGF on the same element.

01:26.380 --> 01:31.980
We already have Engy for on and check if number modals.

01:32.020 --> 01:40.660
So the presenter assigned to if that is equal to zero which would mean now we only display even elements

01:40.660 --> 01:41.440
right.

01:41.980 --> 01:47.910
If we do this we get an error because we can't have more than one structural directive on the same element

01:47.920 --> 01:49.400
that just doesn't work.

01:49.480 --> 01:53.160
But we don't need that we can change it differently.

01:53.230 --> 01:59.480
We can simply make a tiny change to our main app here and implement odd numbers.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.410
Which is 1 3 and 5.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.790
And then of course even numbers.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.200
And that is just a demo app for directives.

02:09.200 --> 02:09.560
Right.

02:09.590 --> 02:14.510
So that might not be the best solution for your app where you really need this behavior later in the

02:14.510 --> 02:19.410
pipe section you will learn how to dynamically folder an array for example.

02:19.490 --> 02:26.210
So here even would be you and for that I'm going to comment out the first numbers are great.

02:26.360 --> 02:33.210
And instead you're all loob for all my odd numbers and output all year.

02:33.350 --> 02:36.870
And of course we can do the same for d even numbers now.

02:36.890 --> 02:40.440
So even of even numbers.

02:40.600 --> 02:43.650
And now to display only one of 2.

02:43.850 --> 02:49.300
We can simply wrap them in let's say a div.

02:49.340 --> 02:52.160
So let's put the list item inside of the div.

02:52.400 --> 02:58.430
And on that day if we could place NGF and now the first one should only be displayed if only all is

02:58.430 --> 02:59.600
true.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.320
Now let's do the same for the second one here.

03:02.450 --> 03:09.510
Let's place them in here and we place Engy of on there to where we check if not only odd and maybe also

03:09.530 --> 03:15.690
replace even here we now see we can't toggle between the two lists so this is now working with Engy

03:15.690 --> 03:16.870
for an NGF.

03:16.870 --> 03:18.880
Nothing new something we already learned.

03:18.940 --> 03:23.320
So these are the two structural directives you learn about and how we may use them and that you can

03:23.350 --> 03:25.070
combine them on the same element.

03:25.330 --> 03:31.810
Before we dive deeper into this well let's also have a look at the two attribute directives you learn

03:31.830 --> 03:33.940
as far two of the most prominent ones.
