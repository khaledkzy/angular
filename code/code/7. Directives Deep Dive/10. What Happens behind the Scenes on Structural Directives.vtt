00:02.750 --> 00:08.180
So now that we had a closer look at attribute directives and created our own one before creating our

00:08.240 --> 00:10.300
own structural directive.

00:10.610 --> 00:14.570
Let me explain why this star is actually required.

00:14.570 --> 00:18.680
This star indicates to angle that this is a structural directive.

00:18.680 --> 00:25.700
The question is why does it need to know because structural directives with that star actually are just

00:25.730 --> 00:31.030
a nicer way for us to use them basically behind the scenes.

00:31.040 --> 00:40.820
ENGLER will transform them into something else because there is no star in Angra syntax when using Well

00:40.820 --> 00:44.440
directives or when using property binding or anything like that.

00:44.510 --> 00:49.160
There is only property binding event binding to wear binding and string interpellation.

00:49.160 --> 00:53.900
And there is no star operator or something like that.

00:53.930 --> 01:01.100
So behind the scenes angular needs to transform this energy usage into something where we end up with

01:01.100 --> 01:03.470
these tools properly binding and so on.

01:03.650 --> 01:04.830
And it does.

01:05.210 --> 01:08.760
I can write the same list here differently.

01:09.170 --> 01:16.250
So if I try to write as only or block differently I would end up with the following.

01:16.430 --> 01:23.910
I would have Engy template element that is provided by angler as TNG indicates.

01:24.440 --> 01:30.930
And inside this element we have the content we conditionally want to render.

01:31.130 --> 01:39.400
So in this case here we would have a div inside of this and in this day of our list item.

01:39.620 --> 01:45.480
Now you probably see that it's basically the same but that it's wrapped in Engy template.

01:45.480 --> 01:52.080
The reason for this is that Engy template is an element which itself is not rendered but which allows

01:52.080 --> 01:54.870
us to define a template in the end.

01:54.870 --> 02:01.710
For angler to use once it determines that this template some element needs to be rendered because this

02:01.710 --> 02:03.790
condition is true in this case.

02:04.200 --> 02:11.400
So on the Engy template we place NGF and now not we have to start because this is the form to which

02:11.400 --> 02:14.360
it will get transformed due to the star.

02:14.610 --> 02:23.770
But instead of a tool we already know with property binding and here we simply bind Well not only art.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.420
So deconditioned.

02:25.590 --> 02:28.340
So now we're back to the tools we know without the star.

02:28.440 --> 02:35.160
And that's why we have to start because obviously that's the more intuitive syntax to use directly placing

02:35.160 --> 02:37.810
it on the element we want to conditionally render.

02:38.010 --> 02:43.800
But that would be the real content behind the scenes to which it gets transformed.

02:43.800 --> 02:48.400
Now you don't need to use that but I find it super important to be aware of this.

02:48.420 --> 02:54.330
Now therefore if we save this we see de-list twice and we see it disappear and appear twice because

02:54.330 --> 02:56.370
it works exactly the same.

02:56.460 --> 03:02.460
It is exactly the same code behind the scenes Desire's what the star transforms it to
