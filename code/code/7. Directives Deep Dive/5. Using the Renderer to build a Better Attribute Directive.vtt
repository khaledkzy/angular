00:02.520 --> 00:06.900
In the last lecture we drilled our first basic directive and it's doing its job.

00:06.910 --> 00:11.190
We learned how to create a selector how to use that selector like an attribute.

00:11.200 --> 00:16.540
In this case since we set up an attribute selector and how to register an module we also learned how

00:16.540 --> 00:19.420
to get access to the element of directive sits on.

00:19.420 --> 00:25.160
This however is not the best way of changing that style because as you might recall from some early

00:25.230 --> 00:31.310
lecture in the course accessing elements directly like this is not a good practice.

00:31.420 --> 00:38.050
You should use a different tool which I'll show you in a second because Engler actually is also able

00:38.050 --> 00:44.960
to render your templates without a dom and then these properties might not be available.

00:44.980 --> 00:51.070
It could do this when using service workers so basically some advanced use cases but nonetheless it's

00:51.070 --> 00:54.400
not a good practice to directly access your elements.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.150
How should we access them then.

00:56.500 --> 01:02.350
Well there is some Abara Harbor you can and checked it's the renderer So let's do this.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.280
But actually let's not do it.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.940
Our basic Heiler directive.

01:06.070 --> 01:12.670
Let's create a new one in four days I will create a new one with the generate command or just g as you

01:12.670 --> 01:20.540
learned with the Seelye and then directive or just D and then any name of your choice and all named

01:20.560 --> 01:22.450
is better.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.710
Highlight.

01:25.860 --> 01:28.250
So this will give us a new file or two new files.

01:28.310 --> 01:33.270
King delete the testing file and we can also put this into its own folder of course.

01:33.270 --> 01:35.850
It's not the default but let's do it here.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.710
Better highlight.

01:37.740 --> 01:44.460
You could also create a central shared or directives folder where you store all your directives for

01:44.460 --> 01:50.580
now just for all purposes and to have a clear separation and make this easy to see put them into individual

01:50.580 --> 01:57.330
folders to better highlight the effect of your India module I will need to adjust my paths inside just

01:57.330 --> 01:59.850
moved it to the better.

02:00.880 --> 02:08.880
Highlight folder so make sure to point to the right path in the right file then in there we get a select

02:08.880 --> 02:10.580
or better highlight.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.350
Now anti-Second Let's check this better too.

02:13.360 --> 02:21.770
I was referring to it's the render which is of type render too.

02:22.070 --> 02:26.440
And this needs to be imported from ET angular slash core.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.570
Now what does inject that we can use it and I will use energy on it again.

02:30.590 --> 02:34.820
You still stick to this best practice of doing initialization work there.

02:34.850 --> 02:39.640
Make sure to import on it or just on it a year from at AngloGold.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.870
And now let's implement ngi on in a year.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.280
And there I can use the renderer.

02:45.560 --> 02:51.470
I do this by calling the property which I created to your private renderer and there we get a couple

02:51.470 --> 02:55.730
of helper methods you can use to work with the DOM basically.

02:55.730 --> 03:00.530
Now one important Befort I'm interested in here is the set style method.

03:00.530 --> 03:04.700
This method allows us to guess what set the style of some element.

03:04.700 --> 03:10.130
Now the problem here is for that we need to have the element for which you want to set the style.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.240
And of course an angler.

03:11.240 --> 03:15.160
There are different ways of getting such an element here in the directive.

03:15.170 --> 03:16.960
It's exceptionally simple.

03:17.030 --> 03:21.440
We already saw how to get one in the basic directivity basic highlight directive.

03:21.620 --> 03:28.310
We can simply inject the element reference so I'll add another private property here or argument which

03:28.310 --> 03:32.980
will automatically be bound to a private property I should say which are named LGF.

03:33.320 --> 03:43.160
And this will be of type element ref which we then also ask before need to import your element ref from

03:43.220 --> 03:44.860
at a lower court.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.800
Now with this import added here.

03:47.810 --> 03:52.690
Now I can use this element ref here by calling this Allen ref.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.850
And here I then went to access to native element and that's important.

03:56.850 --> 03:59.190
We can pass the itself.

03:59.200 --> 04:04.490
We need to get access to the underlying element and pasters as a first argument here to set style.

04:04.720 --> 04:10.010
Now set style takes a couple of arguments we defined which element we want to style.

04:10.030 --> 04:12.830
Now we have to define which style we want to set.

04:13.030 --> 04:17.950
And that would be the background color in our case with the style property defined.

04:17.950 --> 04:23.680
The first argument we passed to the said style method is de-value we want re-assign for this property.

04:23.680 --> 04:29.730
Now we could set the background color here to blue the fourth and final argument is a Flack's object.

04:29.740 --> 04:34.680
Here we can set a couple of flags for this style and this is optional.

04:34.690 --> 04:35.920
I will leave it out here.

04:36.010 --> 04:42.670
What you could said here are things like if you want to add an important tag so this exclamation mark

04:42.670 --> 04:47.710
important notation for a style to override other styles or something like that.

04:47.740 --> 04:51.180
Now this however does it for my case this year.

04:51.250 --> 04:57.490
And now if we save this with our better to highlight directive already added to AB module we can go

04:57.490 --> 04:59.790
to the app component and add it here too.

04:59.980 --> 05:05.320
I would simply duplicate is paragraph here and use app better highlight here.

05:05.350 --> 05:12.940
Our new directive again which is available through to select or since we also added it to the app module

05:13.300 --> 05:17.260
and then here I want to stalled is with a better directive.

05:17.470 --> 05:24.340
Now if we saved us and let it recompile and reload the browser We already see the blue background here

05:24.370 --> 05:25.890
behind this paragraph.

05:25.900 --> 05:32.050
So our new directive here the battery directive is working and now we're using the render which is a

05:32.050 --> 05:34.960
better approach of accessing the dawn.

05:35.060 --> 05:37.500
Now why is it a better approach.

05:37.770 --> 05:42.360
Singular is not limited to running in the browser here.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.580
Aid for example also works with service workers.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.800
And these are environments where you might not have access to the dorm.

05:49.840 --> 05:56.350
So if you try to change the dorm as you did here in basic highlight by directly accessing the native

05:56.350 --> 06:00.860
element and the style of this element you might get an error in some circumstances.

06:00.940 --> 06:07.030
Now to be honest in most circumstances you probably don't and you probably also know if your app is

06:07.030 --> 06:12.970
going to run in the browser or not still it is a better practice to use the render a for Dom access

06:13.210 --> 06:16.640
and to use the methods to render a provides to access to dawn.

06:16.900 --> 06:22.500
You can learn more about the renderer in an article after this lecture here if you are interested.

06:22.840 --> 06:29.920
Just another note I had to rerecord this part here because the renderer type you're changed from render

06:29.920 --> 06:31.790
a V-2 to just render it.

06:31.820 --> 06:38.260
To ask did some arguments you could pass to set style therefore in the average videos in the section

06:38.560 --> 06:42.670
you will see that this code looks slightly different not by much though.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.050
Don't get confused by this.

06:44.050 --> 06:48.850
The code you see here is to code you should use in the code which will work all the average code shown

06:48.850 --> 06:50.980
in the section of course is not changed.

06:50.980 --> 06:52.070
Is Still The Same.

06:52.150 --> 06:59.070
It's only does render sextile method and render a type which is now rendered to and not render a V-2

06:59.080 --> 07:00.680
as you will see in the ABBA videos.

07:00.850 --> 07:02.590
With that let's move on
