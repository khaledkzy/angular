00:02.730 --> 00:08.810
Knouted we understood what the role of the star is we can write our own structural directive.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.980
So let's create a new directive and I will use D.S.O. for this.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.980
I'll name it unless.

00:16.020 --> 00:20.350
So I will basically create the opposite of de NGF directive.

00:20.550 --> 00:26.370
This directive here will attach something only if the condition is false and if does it if the condition

00:26.370 --> 00:27.970
is true.

00:27.990 --> 00:34.350
So here all again delete the spec file here and then he unless correct if I get my selector which is

00:34.350 --> 00:35.590
fine.

00:35.730 --> 00:40.200
Now here I need to get to condition as an input.

00:40.350 --> 00:47.460
So add an input and remember in the end we will use property binding with square brackets because angler

00:47.460 --> 00:49.580
transforms that for us.

00:49.810 --> 00:56.330
We need to of course import input from an Anglo core.

00:56.550 --> 01:04.320
And then here I want to bind to a property named unless which kind of simplistic condition we get.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.050
But whenever this condition changes.

01:07.200 --> 01:14.250
So whenever some input parameter here changes I want to execute a method and therefore I can implement

01:14.280 --> 01:16.960
a set or a set keyword.

01:17.010 --> 01:24.210
This now turnstyles into a method though technically and that's important to understand this still is

01:24.270 --> 01:25.370
a property.

01:25.470 --> 01:31.560
It's just a set her off the property which is a method which gets executed whenever the property changes

01:31.770 --> 01:36.180
and it of course changes whenever it changes outside of the directive.

01:36.170 --> 01:43.740
So whenever the condition we pass changes or some parameter of this condition unless therefore needs

01:43.740 --> 01:49.210
to receive the value the property would normally get as an input.

01:49.410 --> 01:53.070
And we know that this will be a boolean because that will be our condition in the end.

01:53.070 --> 02:01.110
So we could also name this condition then we can check if the condition is not true which is the case

02:01.110 --> 02:09.450
in which I want to display something because unless the opposite of NGF and if the condition is true

02:09.480 --> 02:12.080
well then I want to display nothing.

02:12.210 --> 02:18.060
So that is how we get to condition how we use it how do we display something.

02:18.220 --> 02:28.570
Keep in mind that our unless directive here in the end will sit on such Engy a template component because

02:28.570 --> 02:32.780
that is what gets transformed to by angle or if we use Istari.

02:33.110 --> 02:39.020
So we can get access to this template and we also need to get access to the place in the document where

02:39.020 --> 02:42.700
we want to render it both can be injected.

02:43.370 --> 02:51.110
The template can be injected by adding template ref any name you like but the type is of type template

02:51.110 --> 02:51.690
ref.

02:51.830 --> 02:57.830
So just like element ref gave us access to the element that directive was on Templi draft does the same

02:57.830 --> 03:04.540
for a template and is a generic type you can simply pass any here and we need to import template ref

03:04.550 --> 03:09.940
from an Anglo core the second information piece we need is to view container.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.750
So where should we read it.

03:11.950 --> 03:15.220
The template as to what now are the questions where.

03:15.670 --> 03:23.410
So I'll name a VC reference for you contain a reference and the type is the container reference or view

03:23.410 --> 03:24.460
container ref.

03:24.520 --> 03:31.870
Which is also imported from an English core that marks the place where we placed this directive in the

03:31.870 --> 03:32.770
document.

03:32.770 --> 03:38.920
Angler marks this place and you can see those if you expect that in the developer tools actually.

03:38.980 --> 03:46.720
So we have these two tools available we can use the VC ref whenever the condition changes to call the

03:46.720 --> 03:54.820
Create embedded method which does just what the name applies it creates a view in this view container

03:55.570 --> 03:58.070
and the view simply is our template ref.

03:58.120 --> 04:04.030
So this template we created there is exactly this reference to the template there is exactly what we

04:04.030 --> 04:04.880
need.

04:05.380 --> 04:11.920
Well and if the condition is true in this case so if its not what we were looking for then we would

04:11.920 --> 04:17.350
simply call the clear method to remove everything from this place in the dawn.

04:18.010 --> 04:22.880
With that our own directive a set up of course we need to make sure that it is added here.

04:22.900 --> 04:33.670
The seal I did this for us and now India component we can use our own directive may be to replace NGF

04:33.680 --> 04:38.030
here so I'll comment out all this stuff here.

04:39.190 --> 04:47.170
And only copied the original day of down their comments and of course.

04:47.390 --> 04:54.410
So here instead of using NGF all use app unless and star is important because it still is a structural

04:54.410 --> 04:55.140
directive.

04:55.220 --> 05:00.810
Otherwise we would have to manually write Did we have this Engy templates and next you'll learn before.

05:01.490 --> 05:06.820
So here of course we don't want to check if only orders false because keep in mind too unless they're

05:06.820 --> 05:09.300
active we'll check for the opposite already.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.070
So here we have to pass just only art.

05:12.480 --> 05:19.010
And with this in place we get that we can bind to app unless because it's not a known property why do

05:19.010 --> 05:22.980
we get this Cambre really hard to track.

05:22.980 --> 05:29.460
We get this error because we're trying to do is we have property binding here custom property binding

05:29.520 --> 05:33.430
with an input and we're binding a property named unless.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.720
Now keep in mind D-Star.

05:35.730 --> 05:41.700
Automatically transforms this this energy template syntax where we then try to property bind to the

05:41.700 --> 05:49.350
directive name which is F unless we have to make sure that our property here shares the name of the

05:49.740 --> 05:50.930
directive app.

05:50.970 --> 05:51.750
Unless.

05:51.780 --> 05:55.200
Exactly the same the same as the selector.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.160
Now with this it works fine.

05:57.210 --> 06:02.160
And as you can see if I toggle here we get the same behavior as before.

06:02.160 --> 06:08.040
Even though I commented out the NGF block and use my own app unless they're active instead.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.610
So daises our own custom structural directive but
