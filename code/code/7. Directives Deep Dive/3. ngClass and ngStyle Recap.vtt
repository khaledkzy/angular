00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.410
There are of course many attribute directives and throughout this course you will see different ones

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.460
too we already learned about our energy class and style.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.300
Now just to quickly refresh how they work.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.230
Let's add a class to our osiers file here.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.820
That's maybe name it ought.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.130
And here I simply want to set the color to read.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.110
Now in my template I want to assign this class if it is odd.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.210
So here of course I could always assign a class since we already make sure that this list item list

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.700
is only displayed if only all is checked.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:48.840
Still we could also use energy class here like this and make sure that we assign the OT seeis as class

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.420
therefore we define it here as a property name only if the number we currently look at divided by two

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.010
with the modulus sine equals something else than 0.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.170
So not equal to zero.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.750
That means we have a remainder for this division which means it's odd.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.870
Now we can copy this to the even list.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.510
And again I know that this will never be odd here because we already make sure that this is only rendered

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.880
if we are not displaying odd items.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.360
We don't have any odd items in the even numbers array.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.910
So just to show how this works.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.880
Of course we have to check even here.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.300
Now you see even numbers are Bleck odd numbers are red.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.860
Again not super surprising but just a brief refresher on how Engy class worked and important dimension

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.130
before the square brackets here indicate that we are binding to some property on our energy class directive

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.380
now and the style was d our famous director.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.010
We had a look at thus far.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.440
And style allows us to also pass an object to some property which is also named Engy style on the same

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.380
directive.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:08.420
And here we could simply set the background color and we could set it to read like this.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.510
Now it would always be red but of course we can also say that dynamic value here so we could simply

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.460
repeat our check from up here.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:26.240
If it's an odd number in which case I want to gift is that say background color of yellow.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.630
Otherwise it's transparent.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.390
Now I'll quickly copy this over to our other list here of course.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.150
I'd check if even is basically even and guess what I think it will be.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.190
And now the number is still no styling at all.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.990
And the odd numbers are really ugly now to be honest.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.490
But that means our directors here are working.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.150
Now let's pull their own ones because that is something we can do too.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.730
Let's start with our own attributes are active
