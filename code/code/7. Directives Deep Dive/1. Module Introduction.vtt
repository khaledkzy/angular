00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:08.350
Time to take a hour look at directors and not only repeat quickly what we've learned thus far but also

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.990
learn how to build our own directives and really dive into the difference between attribute and structural

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.600
directives.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.130
And what this star means on the structural directives.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.280
Well I already said it right.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.190
We get attribute and structural directives attribute directives are called like this because they sit

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.860
on elements just like attributes and structural directives basically do the same.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.250
But they also change the structure of the dorm around this element.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:44.490
If you have Engy on a paragraph if that condition is false this paragraph is removed from the dorm.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.110
So the overall view container is affected.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.840
Whereas on the attribute directive you never destroy the element from the dawn.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.280
You only change properties of that element.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.480
For example the background color.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.980
So that is why we have attribute directives only affecting the element they sit on and structural directives

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.200
which also affect the whole dorm or in the view container or the area around the element which they

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.930
were placed on.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.290
That is the difference.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.020
Now if that let's briefly have a look at the directives we already know in how to use them before we

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.290
then dive into building our own ones and learn more about structural directives.
