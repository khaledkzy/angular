Want to conclude the section with one ever built in structural directive which might be handy from time

00:08.600 --> 00:18.210
to time energies switch imagine decays that we have a value like this which is simply 10.

00:18.620 --> 00:20.330
Anything you want.

00:20.330 --> 00:26.530
Now we got a place where Edward disvalue changes and we get a couple of different messages.

00:26.540 --> 00:34.930
We want to display for each of these values for this we can use ngi switch.

00:34.970 --> 00:36.310
So let's add a new db.

00:36.320 --> 00:42.970
Below are paragraphs with our own attribute directives and entries which is used like this.

00:43.070 --> 00:46.280
We are blind to and you switch with property binding.

00:46.310 --> 00:49.670
So no start at this point and we point to value.

00:49.790 --> 00:50.810
So there's our condition.

00:50.810 --> 00:56.110
Basically what we want to check and then you might be aware that switch has a couple of cases we can

00:56.240 --> 00:57.330
cover.

00:57.470 --> 01:00.810
So let's say we have a paragraph where we say value is five.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.490
Then we have the same for 10.

01:02.660 --> 01:07.320
Then we have to say for 100 and maybe for default.

01:07.400 --> 01:13.190
Now we need to add something to these paragraphs to control which paragraph gets shown because it should

01:13.220 --> 01:22.920
only be one of these at a time that something is and you switch case and we simply pass the value for

01:22.920 --> 01:28.310
this case here as an argument for example 5 and we need to start at the beginning.

01:28.310 --> 01:29.690
That's super important.

01:29.690 --> 01:35.360
So here the star comes into play again because behind the scenes this is done all xul transformed by

01:35.360 --> 01:36.420
angular.

01:36.830 --> 01:44.080
So now we can use this here for the average use cases two with 10 and with 100.

01:44.540 --> 01:51.660
And finally for the default case we have Engy switch default like this.

01:51.740 --> 01:58.670
Now here we also need to add to store of course with this in place if we save this we only see 10 here.

01:58.850 --> 02:06.240
And if I go to my component and I change this to 5 like this then of course we see five.

02:06.280 --> 02:11.920
So this is Energis which super easy to use might be useful in some cases where you find yourself creating

02:11.920 --> 02:18.100
a lot of energy if conditions energies which might be the better solution in such cases.

02:18.100 --> 02:23.940
So there is structural directives finished and there is directives overall finished.

02:23.980 --> 02:29.200
You'll learn a lot about them and I hope this knowledge allows you to create awesome directives for

02:29.200 --> 02:34.120
your applications in cases where the built in ones aren't everything you need.

02:34.150 --> 02:38.750
Even though these already cover a lot of the default use cases to be honest.

02:38.890 --> 02:45.130
So let's move on let's add a directive to our recipe book in the next section and then let's move on

02:45.250 --> 02:46.090
in the courts.

02:46.090 --> 02:46.870
See you there.
