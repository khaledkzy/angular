You'll learn a bit about the basics of sending requests and handling responses with this new HTP client.

00:09.330 --> 00:15.720
And the last I actually had a look at how you can listen to events instead of D just the response which

00:15.720 --> 00:21.170
is the default you were listening to now when everything we can do which I already touched on is you

00:21.200 --> 00:25.810
can set headers now in index options object.

00:25.830 --> 00:31.560
They're just as hetero's property you can set and they're actually set new headers you want to send

00:31.560 --> 00:40.740
with your request with the new age to the headers object so by instantiating this you'll need to import

00:40.770 --> 00:44.970
that from the same path as you import declined.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.080
So HTP headers like that.

00:48.150 --> 00:50.760
Now it should be read headers is as I said instantiated.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.520
So don't forget the parentheses.

00:52.710 --> 00:59.040
And this gives you a HTP header's object which behind the scenes just is a javascript object holding

00:59.040 --> 01:03.760
some extra in configuration so that the client can use it.

01:03.990 --> 01:10.500
No discipline doesn't set any special headers besides the default headers it will send Anyways if you

01:10.500 --> 01:17.700
want to set headers you can simply change a method call to this newly instantiated object so you can

01:17.700 --> 01:24.820
simply call a new method and there are various methods available for getting the headers but all for

01:24.900 --> 01:32.910
a pending a new headers or setting headers and just as a side note there are some default headers which

01:32.910 --> 01:39.210
are sent with every request sometimes even enforced by your browser which you won't overwrite with deaths.

01:39.390 --> 01:46.600
I'm talking about your own headers which you reset and override with set or which you append with.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.180
Well append.

01:48.570 --> 01:53.520
Since we don't have any custom headers yet let's set some add here.

01:53.540 --> 02:01.420
Does a super simple set simply takes two arguments the name of the header or the key and then the value.

02:01.590 --> 02:09.570
So for example if you were to set an authorization header here we could simply pass the authorization.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.300
Maybe barer and some token.

02:12.360 --> 02:18.360
No this won't work with this firebase set up because we don't all ferrites ourselves Frewer offer I

02:18.370 --> 02:19.710
sation header dare.

02:19.860 --> 02:26.120
But it is a common use case that you are talking to some API where you do need to set an offsite sation

02:26.130 --> 02:27.680
header with some token.

02:27.750 --> 02:31.530
This would be an example and this is how you set headers in general.

02:31.530 --> 02:35.220
Now if you want to add more simply append them.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.060
This is how you can add more headers to that.

02:39.150 --> 02:43.320
Of course you don't have to do all of that inline in the Options object.

02:43.320 --> 02:50.460
You could prepare an object in advance headers object where you simply used the headers or set them

02:50.460 --> 02:56.310
up whip's as we did in line and then pass these headers.

02:56.370 --> 02:57.250
Object here.

02:57.270 --> 02:58.760
This is the alternative.

02:58.950 --> 03:04.570
Now as I mentioned this won't work here because firebase doesn't expect us head but in general this

03:04.580 --> 03:06.630
is absolutely how it works.

03:06.670 --> 03:07.660
All commented out.

03:07.680 --> 03:08.490
For now though.
