00:02.440 --> 00:06.900
Now that you'll learn about headers in the last video what about parents.

00:06.910 --> 00:17.140
Clearly parents we do have one here we have plenty of very parameter and DS is something we do right

00:17.170 --> 00:18.330
and you are.

00:18.370 --> 00:19.660
Nothing wrong with that.

00:19.660 --> 00:21.220
It works as you saw.

00:21.400 --> 00:29.660
But if you don't want to make sure you are dead long and you don't want to hard code all your carry

00:29.680 --> 00:36.580
parents in there and change your strings and combine them with variables like we do there is a more

00:36.580 --> 00:39.260
convenient way of setting Querrey parents.

00:39.280 --> 00:46.630
You can set the parents object in this configuration object you are passing as a third or in the case

00:46.630 --> 00:49.540
of get second argument.

00:49.540 --> 00:57.710
So here parents takes a new HTP parents object just like HP hetero's.

00:57.720 --> 01:02.980
This has to be imported from any angle or common HTP.

01:03.070 --> 01:07.180
Now you have to instantiate it and then it works pretty much like headers.

01:07.180 --> 01:13.380
You can set and append parameters set overrides all existing Clarie parents and sets the one you're

01:13.390 --> 01:14.340
passing here.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.750
Append simply adds to existing ones.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.100
You can also delete them.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.970
Get the ones you already configured and so on.

01:21.250 --> 01:22.920
So you don't want to set them.

01:23.110 --> 01:25.200
And again we have two arguments here.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.830
The first one is the key.

01:27.940 --> 01:29.530
In this case it would be off.

01:29.670 --> 01:35.820
So a copy of in there and the second one is the value in this case it's token.

01:35.890 --> 01:37.350
So that's as token.

01:37.630 --> 01:44.350
This now gives us the chance of removing all this part including the questionmark and simply having

01:44.410 --> 01:50.530
the Your else here will still at stickery parents but will do it for this configuration which is a bit

01:50.530 --> 01:51.470
cleaner.

01:51.790 --> 01:58.830
What saved us and see if it works we should still be able to save values to firebase without any issues.

01:58.930 --> 02:02.620
Since this should append the token dynamically.

02:02.620 --> 02:10.300
So let's go back to the application and quickly log in which gives us this token and that's now called

02:10.300 --> 02:14.490
Save and we shouldn't see any error solutes click save.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.130
This looks good.

02:15.130 --> 02:19.540
We'll get back to D.C. The response which just confirms what we saved.

02:19.540 --> 02:26.440
No errors were frozen so hence this worked and does the typical use case or a typical thing where you

02:26.440 --> 02:34.750
can make your usual shorter and Chesed have the key DD endpoint you are targeting in there and add all

02:34.750 --> 02:41.180
the parameters you might want to pass where the parameters fruiterer's parents configuration here.

02:41.230 --> 02:48.020
And of course you can do the same for the get request to get rid of d of part in your use or else there

02:48.020 --> 02:48.520
too.
