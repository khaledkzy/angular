00:02.240 --> 00:06.220
In this module you'll learn a lot about this new HTP client.

00:06.340 --> 00:13.360
You work out how you can easily replace your old HTP code using the old client with the new one you'll

00:13.360 --> 00:17.370
learn how you can treat your old intercessors and work with these.

00:17.370 --> 00:21.700
Now again just because it's important D-New you declined.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.270
It's only an alternative.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.790
You don't have to use it.

00:24.850 --> 00:28.500
You can but you can absolutely stick to the old client.

00:28.690 --> 00:34.390
I've found it important to introduce you to it though and I hope that this model was helpful to you.
