00:02.660 --> 00:08.900
Welcome to this bonus model with angle of 4.2 and you HTP client was released.

00:08.930 --> 00:14.590
Now I do already cover HTP in this course and the new client is only an alternative.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.010
This is super important.

00:16.010 --> 00:21.940
The old Kalighat which I do teach in this course is perfectly valid and you can still use it.

00:21.940 --> 00:25.040
It's not deprecated or anything like that.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.380
The new client is an alternative.

00:27.440 --> 00:35.510
Behind the scenes it uses a more modern API and the most important thing probably is it supports more

00:35.570 --> 00:37.860
advanced features than the old Klein did.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.480
Most importantly intercessors.

00:40.700 --> 00:47.060
Now I'll dive into these features in this module and I'll walk you through this new client and explain

00:47.060 --> 00:52.660
how it works how you may use it and how you can replace your old code with it.

00:52.700 --> 00:54.130
So let's get started.
