00:02.180 --> 00:09.470
So let's look at the new HTP client angle or offer us now as a side note if you want to dive much deeper

00:09.470 --> 00:10.070
into it.

00:10.070 --> 00:17.360
Visit the official docks under a or thought I know docs and they're under fundamentals you should find

00:17.360 --> 00:17.660
this.

00:17.700 --> 00:24.740
HP declined article where you can dive super deep into it and go in some advanced topics though it will

00:24.740 --> 00:32.090
cover quite a lot of the stuff you find here in this core section and you can always get to the AP documentation

00:32.390 --> 00:34.470
and search for HTP here.

00:34.610 --> 00:40.940
And then it's just common HTP section here which covers all the classes and types and interfaces connected

00:40.940 --> 00:43.370
to the new HP Client.

00:43.400 --> 00:46.090
However now you don't need to do that upfront.

00:46.100 --> 00:50.520
Of course I will walk you through it and explain how it works and what you can do with it.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.140
Let's close this for now.

00:52.310 --> 00:58.990
Back in the project you can find attached to this video a version of this project which is just the

00:59.000 --> 00:59.950
final word.

00:59.990 --> 01:07.160
The one we optimized with various modules so we have the recipe module and our shared Marchal and all

01:07.160 --> 01:07.930
that stuff.

01:08.060 --> 01:13.610
So you can find an attached data to the latest version of Angel or at the point of time I'm recording

01:13.610 --> 01:18.220
this because this HTP client isn't the way Lebel in Angola afforded.

01:18.270 --> 01:21.400
Oh but it is available in the latest word.

01:21.590 --> 01:26.530
So you can simply download the word and attached this video to get started quickly.

01:26.540 --> 01:32.770
Now with that out of the way we get our base set up you know where to dive deeper if you want to.

01:32.780 --> 01:40.920
Let's now dive into the HTP client and let's start by replacing our Ivor HTP methods.

01:40.920 --> 01:46.970
We got your data storage service with didn't you HTP methods by this new HDB client.
