00:02.370 --> 00:05.980
So where you're successful let's create some modules together.

00:06.150 --> 00:11.890
I'll start with the shopping list module here I'll create a new fall shopping list.

00:11.900 --> 00:18.780
Maggio and I will export my class shopping list.

00:18.840 --> 00:23.540
MARSHALL Just like that of course as you learned.

00:23.580 --> 00:31.140
We have to add DNG module decorator to it and import that decorator from an English court and then just

00:31.140 --> 00:36.000
like with the recipes Marchal we're going to declare everything all components ends on which make up

00:36.000 --> 00:37.640
our shopping list Marchal.

00:37.980 --> 00:40.190
Well here these are only two components.

00:40.350 --> 00:43.140
All the components with shopping list in the name basically.

00:43.140 --> 00:49.140
So the shopping lists component and the shopping list added or are you shopping at a component.

00:49.140 --> 00:52.090
Make sure to also ads to import pauvres.

00:52.200 --> 00:58.560
Now for the same reasons as before I won't add the provider of my shopping list service here because

00:58.560 --> 01:03.770
I want to use that service application wide and I don't want to contain it to that module.

01:03.870 --> 01:10.040
Side note again it would be provide an application wide in the current set up but will soon change something

01:10.050 --> 01:13.920
where that would not be the case anymore or probably not be the case anymore.

01:14.130 --> 01:19.170
And as I don't want that to happen well I will not put it in your in the first place which is a typical

01:19.230 --> 01:20.980
setup to not put it here.

01:21.120 --> 01:26.070
Now with the component set up we also have to think about which modules we use here.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.750
So I will simply import something here.

01:28.980 --> 01:34.350
I don't need to import a shared module because whilst we will need the common module we don't need to

01:34.350 --> 01:40.650
drop down directive so we could import the tier wouldn't hurt our app but it also doesn't make that

01:40.650 --> 01:41.640
much sense.

01:41.640 --> 01:48.440
I will only import the common module and of course add to import Poth from at Anglo or common.

01:48.660 --> 01:57.210
And I will also import the forms all year from at angle reference forms module unlocks all these forms

01:57.210 --> 02:00.300
directives like ngi model Engy model group.

02:00.570 --> 02:07.350
So that's my shopping list module in the app Marchal I can now get rid of the shopping list components

02:07.350 --> 02:08.130
here.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.590
Also remove the imports from the top.

02:10.650 --> 02:16.980
You can already see that this file gets leaner and I can get rid of the form's module import because

02:17.070 --> 02:19.920
we don't use these forms Martial's anywhere else in the app.

02:20.130 --> 02:25.890
Of course if you use energy model including in a two way binding context anywhere else in the app you

02:25.890 --> 02:27.260
have to leave it here.

02:27.450 --> 02:33.280
But you would then still have to import it in your shopping list module because the directives X-post

02:33.300 --> 02:37.810
by the form's module are only enabled in the module where you did import it.

02:37.860 --> 02:39.470
So that's something to keep in mind.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.290
You then would have to import it to modules not just in the module.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.430
That is only true for services.

02:45.450 --> 02:50.790
These are the only elements which only have to be provided once and not in multiple modules.

02:50.820 --> 02:55.240
What we definitely do have to add in the module now is our shopping list.

02:55.290 --> 02:56.190
Marchal.

02:56.190 --> 03:00.740
So let's edit it here and make sure to also add that import path.

03:00.780 --> 03:01.760
Now with that.

03:01.770 --> 03:03.050
What about the routing.

03:03.150 --> 03:09.810
You could create a shopping list routing module where you provide or what you set up all the shopping

03:09.810 --> 03:15.450
list related routes and then use for child just like you saw it here in the rest of his routing module.

03:15.780 --> 03:21.390
If you have a look at this file it makes sense that we created routing files for the recipe routing

03:21.830 --> 03:23.250
while routes.

03:23.340 --> 03:28.430
If we have a look at our app routing file it doesn't make a lot of sense for the shopping list.

03:28.440 --> 03:35.400
We only have one route which is related to shopping list and if we leave the around here or put it into

03:35.490 --> 03:38.830
a sub file away with shopping list routing file.

03:38.850 --> 03:42.380
I don't think we save a lot with that so I will leave it here.

03:42.630 --> 03:50.070
Now of course we use this component to shopping list component here so that means that the app routing

03:50.070 --> 03:55.860
module file where we can remove all the imports where we don't use the types anymore.

03:56.070 --> 04:01.380
We have to leave the shopping list component import here because we are referring to the type.

04:01.590 --> 04:05.090
And now here is something I want to take a closer look at.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.070
I will do so in the next lecture
