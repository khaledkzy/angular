In the last lecture I highlighted the difference between using the selector and routing and declaring

00:07.960 --> 00:09.370
of components.

00:09.370 --> 00:12.990
Now let's go back to our shopping list module and finish it.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.880
But actually it is finished.

00:14.920 --> 00:20.560
So if we have a look at this and the running application and now we see we have an error.

00:20.950 --> 00:23.160
Well the reason for this is dead.

00:23.160 --> 00:29.900
We're also using energy model in our sign up and sign in components which also use forms.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.510
So that is what I referred to earlier.

00:32.560 --> 00:40.640
You have to make sure that the form's module which simply unlocks a couple of directives is provided

00:40.810 --> 00:46.900
every Not just one in every module where you want to use these directives and since remove that from

00:46.900 --> 00:51.230
the app module and only put it in the shopping list module.

00:51.310 --> 00:53.590
We can't access it anywhere else.

00:53.590 --> 01:01.420
Now one thing we could do is we could export it here form's module and if we do that and let the app

01:01.420 --> 01:03.460
reload you'll see it's working again.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.700
But that's not really what you should do.

01:05.710 --> 01:12.210
You shouldn't export a module in a feature module so that a number of feature modules able to use it.

01:12.520 --> 01:19.450
You should do that in each module so that well you really see which modules a module uses what have

01:19.480 --> 01:20.920
modules here right.

01:21.280 --> 01:26.680
Well let's fix this in a different way though by simply creating a number of feature modules for the

01:26.680 --> 01:31.900
off section where we then can explicitly import our forms module.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.110
You will do this in the next lecture
