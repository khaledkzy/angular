00:02.520 --> 00:06.290
So let's build our off feature module.

00:06.330 --> 00:07.500
Maybe you already did it.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.860
If not feel yourself challenged to do this on your own.

00:11.130 --> 00:13.390
But I will do it together with you now.

00:13.740 --> 00:23.010
So in the off folder here I will now create my off module TS file which will hold my off module and

00:23.330 --> 00:30.780
while you already learn that we add energy modules here to make that a module we then also add the import

00:30.780 --> 00:33.200
to that from an Anglo core.

00:33.720 --> 00:40.790
And now we need to declare what should be inside our all module what what should be inside in our declarations.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.100
We need to declare which components and directives you use here.

00:44.310 --> 00:48.960
And we only use the seinen component anti-siphon up component like this.

00:48.960 --> 00:52.640
Make sure you also add imports to both files.

00:52.680 --> 00:56.910
We also need to import any modules you might use here.

00:57.240 --> 01:03.290
Now we don't need to import the shared module because we don't really use anything from that.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.220
We don't use to drop down directive.

01:05.370 --> 01:11.460
We don't even use a common module because we're neber using energy class styles for or for any of the

01:11.460 --> 01:13.480
above common directives.

01:13.500 --> 01:18.380
Now if you get an error or about some directive missing you probably should add it because maybe you

01:18.380 --> 01:22.890
somehow added some directive but I don't use any of these directives.

01:23.130 --> 01:27.860
So the only module I need to import here is the forms module.

01:27.960 --> 01:36.540
And with that imported from an English forms I can now go to my app Marchal and your import to my off

01:36.630 --> 01:37.780
module.

01:37.950 --> 01:40.720
Make sure to also add the import lbf here.

01:42.020 --> 01:46.660
Now with that added here I can remove the sign up and sign in component from the declarations array

01:47.330 --> 01:52.040
and remove the imports you don't need any more including the forms module.

01:52.230 --> 01:55.590
And we should see that our application still works.

01:55.590 --> 02:00.190
Once this relo to your if I go do you log in and register pages.

02:00.200 --> 02:05.620
That seems to work and if I do actually log in looks fine.

02:05.630 --> 02:07.900
So with that we created the app Marchal.

02:07.910 --> 02:15.870
However Ford is Mauch all we could think about outsourcing our off related routes from the routing module.

02:15.920 --> 02:23.360
So I will go to the off Marchal and create my office routing module file and hearable Kuechly export

02:23.690 --> 02:29.820
of routing module and again attach N-G module does decorator to it.

02:30.660 --> 02:34.450
And with that add as you're here I don't need to declare anything.

02:34.560 --> 02:42.210
Instead I simply want to import the router module to register my routes and avoid it.

02:42.210 --> 02:44.070
I need to find a router first.

02:44.070 --> 02:51.690
So my all routes which is simply of type or ought to be imported from the ED angle or router package.

02:52.020 --> 02:59.700
Well you offer zealots here can be copied or kept from the operating module and I can put them into

02:59.700 --> 03:02.610
the off routing module here.

03:03.480 --> 03:10.710
Of course now we also have to add the imports to these components again only for typescript.

03:11.070 --> 03:16.110
And in the Eberling module I can remove these imports because we don't reference these types anymore.

03:16.140 --> 03:23.250
So the Aberdeen Marchal really got a lot leaner now and now in the off routing module year I can again

03:23.310 --> 03:33.330
import the router module and then register my router with for child off routes here and now also export

03:33.630 --> 03:36.470
the router module in an array like that.

03:36.540 --> 03:43.160
Roger Marchal needs to be imported from every angle or router and we want to use that in the off module.

03:43.170 --> 03:51.900
So let's add an import duty of routing module and since we import the all module in the AB module these

03:51.900 --> 03:54.750
routes which are registered with for child.

03:54.780 --> 04:01.050
Which simply means for a child to module and a feature module is a child module any module except for

04:01.050 --> 04:07.330
the app module is a child module since we have that set up everything should work just like before.

04:07.500 --> 04:13.820
If the app reloads we can still visit all these pages and we can still log in successfully.

04:13.890 --> 04:21.410
So that is the off module created with that we created a lot of feature modules in the next step.

04:21.480 --> 04:27.630
I want to dive deeper into how we can now use these feature modules to improve the performance of our

04:27.630 --> 04:33.450
application and then which SRODES services play in feature modules.
