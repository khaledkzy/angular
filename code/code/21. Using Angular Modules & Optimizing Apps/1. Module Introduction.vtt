Welcome to this course module in this course you learn a lot about angular and about its features.

00:08.910 --> 00:15.960
We use a lot of the features but there was one thing we also used a lot but we never really took a closer

00:15.960 --> 00:16.670
look at it.

00:44.350 --> 00:51.220

00:51.340 --> 00:58.650
