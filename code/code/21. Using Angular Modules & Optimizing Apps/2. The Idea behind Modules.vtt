00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.760
So what's the idea behind these modules in our app.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.930
Let's take a closer look.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.490
Typically our application has a couple of components directives pipes services things like that.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.280
And right now we always have this app module.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.170
In general though in an angular app all these elements which make up your app have to be registered

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.830
in a module or in multiple modules as he will learn in this core section here.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.680
The idea behind it is is that you clearly have to tell angular what your app consists of.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.930
So what are the elements of your app.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.310
Which components to use which directives do you use.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.150
Which services do you use.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.590
You have to be explicit about this because Engler does not scan your directory or files it doesn't include

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.670
all your files automatically.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.220
And by using modules and being clear about what you need.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.920
You also are very clear about what you don't need.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.150
And that of course is a huge thing because this allows you in the end when it comes to building your

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.470
app for production to strip out all the things you don't need.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.300
That's the idea behind modules and right now we only used one module in our app.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.910
That's not wrong or bad but we can improve our app by using multiple modules.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.850
We can make it more maintainable from a developer perspective but we can also use some other advantages

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.700
when it comes to building the app and you will learn all about this in this core section.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.250
Now let me start by taking a closer look at our app module before we don't have a look at which our

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.910
modules we may use in our app
