00:02.280 --> 00:06.800
In the last lectures we worked on our recipes feature module and we learned what feature modules are

00:06.800 --> 00:08.290
to begin with.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.190
Now let's have a look at shared modules.

00:10.190 --> 00:15.350
Let's consider this set up here at Marchal with multiple feature modules though it could also of course

00:15.350 --> 00:21.680
only be one feature module and then we have a directive which is shared across multiple modules ever

00:21.680 --> 00:27.210
shared across multiple feature modules or across the app module and feature modules.

00:27.260 --> 00:34.460
In this case we can put these directives into a shared module which basically is a module not containing

00:34.550 --> 00:39.300
a feature but only something which is shared across multiple module.

00:39.500 --> 00:44.690
Exactly what we will need in our recipe book to make this dropped on the record of available in both

00:44.720 --> 00:51.890
our app module where we use it in the header and the recipes detail component in the recipes module.

00:51.890 --> 00:56.400
So lets see how we can build such a share module and use it in the next lectures.
