WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:06.650
So we added all the components we created to our templates.

00:06.680 --> 00:09.700
Now let's fine tune them and Eddie content.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.190
We want to have their starting in the header.

00:12.260 --> 00:15.450
Of course I don't want to have to say age one th year.

00:15.470 --> 00:21.890
Instead I will use a couple of bootstrap classes to create a nice looking header so I'll create a wrapping

00:21.980 --> 00:28.810
naff element and on this element I'll add the nav bar class and the nav bar default.

00:28.820 --> 00:35.140
Again these are just bootstrap classes which will give me this default bootstrap header in there.

00:35.150 --> 00:42.890
I'll place a container of fluid div to have my own view container basically in there and the first thing

00:42.890 --> 00:44.690
I want to have here is a header.

00:44.810 --> 00:47.800
For that we get the nav bar header class.

00:47.810 --> 00:51.550
We can add to a div and in this day for want of a clickable header.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.980
So at anchor or tag with pointing to a hash.

00:54.980 --> 01:00.140
For now as will later of course add a route there once we learned how to do this and this should have

01:00.140 --> 01:06.610
the class nav bar Rand to give to this brand like textile.

01:06.660 --> 01:15.030
I'll say recipe book here since this is the name of our application so that's the header part of our

01:15.030 --> 01:17.850
headers so the main brand part.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.730
Now let's work on the actual links for this.

01:20.730 --> 01:27.200
I'll add a diff which will receive the call EPS class and then the nav bar call class.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.780
Now I won't really use the collapse feature.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.110
I won't add a hamburger.

01:31.110 --> 01:38.040
I can hear as you will not have many links on our head or any ways but this gives us some nice styles.

01:38.130 --> 01:43.080
And of course collops you should have I eat at the end like that.

01:43.380 --> 01:51.330
So any year I now want to have a group of list items so a group of links in the end will be an ordered

01:51.330 --> 01:57.030
list with the CSA as classes Neph and then nav bar neph.

01:57.270 --> 02:03.300
So make sure you create is unordered list with these classes and in there if we add some list items

02:03.300 --> 02:09.180
they will actually sit next to each other so they will automatically be positioned correctly by bootstrap

02:09.630 --> 02:12.070
each list item should hold a link.

02:12.270 --> 02:19.510
So here I'll add the anchor tag all the pointing to Chesed hash for now one for the recipe section and

02:19.510 --> 02:23.820
the second one for the shopping list section.

02:23.820 --> 02:27.840
Now with that added I'll add another area in my header here.

02:27.870 --> 02:34.530
This will be a number an ordered list which will receive two classes Nav. and now owns the nav bar.

02:34.530 --> 02:41.850
Never like before but then also nav bar right to position DS links at the right and actually this will

02:41.850 --> 02:46.970
only be one link here which will receive a class of dropdown list item.

02:46.980 --> 02:53.910
Will because later we will add our own directive which will turn us into a working dropdown where we

02:53.910 --> 02:59.430
can then she has some options to store our data on a server something that will also implement later

02:59.430 --> 03:02.000
in this course or fetch it from there.

03:02.040 --> 03:10.260
So in the dropdown I simply want to have my dropdown menu which when using bootstrap is added by adding

03:10.350 --> 03:14.720
an ordered list with the class dropdown menu.

03:14.730 --> 03:22.920
So this will halti items offers dropdown and here I'll add a couple of list items which all hold some

03:22.920 --> 03:28.390
links pointing to chust hash for now one for saving data.

03:29.380 --> 03:36.690
And one for fetching data again this will be filled with working code later.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.000
So that's my header.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.060
Let's save it and see how it looks.

03:41.130 --> 03:42.230
Looks ok.

03:42.240 --> 03:45.050
I don't see my drop down there.

03:45.090 --> 03:46.680
The brand looks off.

03:46.890 --> 03:49.650
So I'm not entirely happy with that.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.590
Let's see what is wrong.

03:51.630 --> 03:58.620
The brand is not working because that should be nav bar not have age in between so if you fix this the

03:58.620 --> 04:00.330
brand looks all right.

04:00.330 --> 04:02.410
Now what's wrong with the dropdown.

04:02.730 --> 04:08.350
Well the dropdown simply misses the link we would see to open the dropdown because there's an order

04:08.370 --> 04:10.880
class here simply the content of the dropdown.

04:10.890 --> 04:12.720
We of course also need a link to trigger it.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.740
So let's add a anchor tech pointing to a hash tag here.

04:15.900 --> 04:22.100
We're able to say manage just manage maybe you could of course change that text and dish should have

04:22.260 --> 04:28.230
a class of dropdown toggle because this will be the button talking the drop down in the end.

04:28.340 --> 04:33.390
Therefore it will have a roll of button to add some accessibility to it is not required for this to

04:33.390 --> 04:34.860
work correctly though.

04:35.040 --> 04:40.860
And with this now if you save it as we see the dropdown it would be nice to have a little arrow next

04:40.860 --> 04:43.330
to it indicating that it is a dropdown.

04:43.470 --> 04:50.730
So next to manage I'll add a span with a class of Caray which will give us this arrow pointing to the

04:50.730 --> 04:51.360
bottom.

04:51.390 --> 04:53.850
This arrow here and now we get a drop down.

04:53.850 --> 04:58.740
It won't work if we click it because we haven't added any code which would open the drop down.

04:58.740 --> 05:02.050
We will do this after the directives section though.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.040
So the head is now working.

05:04.050 --> 05:05.320
With that let's move on.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.170
Let's work on our recipes section
