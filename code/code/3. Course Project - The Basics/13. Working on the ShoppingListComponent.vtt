00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:08.580
We're finished for now or our recipes components let's work on the shopping list now.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.240
Now the shopping list component.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:20.660
If we have a look at it here in our files here in the HMO file we already added some content to its

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.650
arm template here.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.210
But instead of saying the list I want to output an ordered list of type list group worth the classless

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.940
group I should say so using this bootstrap class.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.280
And then there I want to have clickable list items.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:42.260
So at anchor tech pointing to Chesed hash for now again to make sure it doesn't reload the page accidentally

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.980
and then add some extra applauses or one class to be precise.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.210
The last group I'd class to make this look like an item in this unordered list and I'll even get rid

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.180
of the anchor text here of the ref.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.990
I should say and therefore I said inline style 2 and 4 is a cursor which looks like the pointer.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:09.530
The reason why I'm removing this is I will later use is like a button and therefore I don't need as

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.090
ref element there.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.720
It would simply lead to unwanted behaviors.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.100
So that will be a single element a single item on our shopping list.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.370
Now to display something here we need an array of ingredients though.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:34.190
So what I'll do for now is I'll add my ingredients property year to the shopping list and this will

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.500
be an empty array.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.090
But now just like with the recipe we're going to use ingredients a lot throughout our app.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.790
Also in the recipe section so we probably should also create a model for this.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.820
Let's do this in the next lecture.
