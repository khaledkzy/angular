<p>The way we added it, the Navbar will collapse on smaller screens. Since we didn't implement a Hamburger menu, that means that there's no way of accessing our links on smaller screens.</p>

<p>You can either add such a menu on your own, or you replace <code>collapse navbar-collapse</code>  with just <code>navbar-default</code> </p>
