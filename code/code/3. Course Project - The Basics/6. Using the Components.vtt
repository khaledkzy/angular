WEBVTT

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.170
We created all these components.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.860
Let's start using them.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.680
I will start using them in the app component age HTML file here where I say I'm working here I want

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.180
to display my app recipe's component.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.950
So the one we created here in the recipe's folder and below it the app shopping list component.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.040
So this component here if we save this we see recipe's works and shopping list works.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.900
Which of course are the default strings.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.830
DC I GAVE us here.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.130
So with these added a working year let's now also work on the individual components here.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.950
Starting with recipe's maybe in my recipe's component.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.310
As I said in my set up I want to have the recipe's list and detail next to each other.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:56.760
So for this I'll add a road day of year and in this role I'll add a day with the last call M.D five

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.280
to have a smaller column on the left and then another one with cold M.D 7 using these bootstrap columns

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.800
sizing classes to have a broader column on the right.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.820
So two columns next to each other.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.880
Now in the first column I want to have my app recipe list component.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.710
And the second one I want to have my app recipe detailed component just like that.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.870
So Datchet placed these two components next to each other.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.000
If we save this and have a look at our app we did see list and detail below each other simply because

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.250
due to the console the viewport was so small and then it automatically reposted below each other.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.370
So if you have a normal page they sit next to each other and I actually want them to wrap below each

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.160
other on smaller pages.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.270
So this is now working to you now in my recipe list component here.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.120
As I said a similar one to include that recipe item.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.040
So here I will later I'll put a list of items for now I will simply include the recipe item your ab

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.710
recipe items are only de-select or which should now ensure that we no longer see your recipe list were

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.210
expert recipe item works because that's the only content of our recipe list component for now.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.910
So that's looking great.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.960
Now for the shopping list of pretty much the same in my shopping list component here I want to display

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.910
the list and above it does shopping added area so I'll add a row here to an industry so that they will

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.610
call excess 10 to create a very wide column here first.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.990
Add my shopping add its component to have this editing area at the top where we can add new ingredients

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.570
or added existing ones.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.660
And then I want to have a horizontal line here and somehow outpoured my list below this.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.930
So that's the rough set of I want to have in this component.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.610
So it should work like this.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.630
That will be the recipe list compiled and later on we're going to folder's with more live.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.750
But for now I'm very happy with how that looks.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.640
Talking about how it looks.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.680
The header really kind of destroys our whole layout here.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.780
So let's work on the head in the next lecture and let's actually bring it into its almost final form

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.520
already.
