00:02.580 --> 00:05.130
Let's use our newly created ingredient model.

00:05.130 --> 00:11.180
So just like with recipe we can now define the type for our ingredients array and this will be of type.

00:11.220 --> 00:17.480
Well ingredient aere And of course for those we have to import ingredients.

00:17.490 --> 00:20.010
Let's quickly do with us from.

00:20.060 --> 00:25.710
And now we have to move up one folder so that we are in the app folder and then we have to go into the

00:25.710 --> 00:32.010
shared folder and there it's an ingredient of model file without the file extension.

00:32.010 --> 00:35.570
With that we can now create one first ingredient.

00:35.610 --> 00:41.650
So let's use our Ingredion constructor and we have to pass name and amount here.

00:41.790 --> 00:51.200
So the name could be apples and we want five let's say and then let's also say we want to have some

00:51.440 --> 00:55.500
tomatoes maybe 10.

00:55.750 --> 00:59.540
That is our shopping list for now.

00:59.920 --> 01:06.580
Now we want to output it here in the component so we get our anchor take your which represents a single

01:06.580 --> 01:10.640
item and now you could put this into its own component too.

01:10.810 --> 01:17.590
But since this is going to be such a straightforward easy item I don't see much sense outsourcing it

01:17.590 --> 01:21.960
into its own component though it wouldn't necessarily be bad to do so.

01:22.060 --> 01:24.170
But I also don't see a great advantage.

01:24.220 --> 01:27.940
There also isn't a lot of business logic attached to this.

01:27.940 --> 01:33.100
So I will place energy for on this anchor tag to loop through all the ingredients.

01:33.100 --> 01:41.630
So ingredient of ingredients and now we can output the ingredient data here inside our anchor tag.

01:41.890 --> 01:47.570
So it makes sense to output the ingredient name I believe.

01:47.920 --> 01:54.090
And then maybe in parentheses thereafter and these parentheses here are no angle or some text that is

01:54.130 --> 01:57.980
normal text here I'm outputting inside the parentheses.

01:58.090 --> 02:06.550
I'm going to use string and appellation to also output ingredient amount with dead if we now save this

02:06.700 --> 02:09.940
we already see our shopping list here at the bottom.

02:10.090 --> 02:16.100
The last missing piece and want to add is this shopping list added section here which should display

02:16.210 --> 02:22.480
the input field which then allows us to actually added our items or add new ones at least later in the

02:22.480 --> 02:22.870
course.

02:22.870 --> 02:25.110
It will add this functionality
