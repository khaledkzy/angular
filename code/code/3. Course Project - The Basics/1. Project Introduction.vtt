00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.000
Time to practice the things you learned thus far in our course project.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.940
Now what is our course project.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.230
My goal in this project which we will build for the course to which will come back after the individual

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.470
sections of this course is to build a recipe book and shopping list app.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.330
You saw it in the intro video off the course.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.070
Basically there we're going to have two sections shopping list and recipe book and we will be able to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.760
manage our recipes viewed them in detail and also to manage our shopping list and even push ingredients

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.400
from our recipe directly to a shopping list.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.380
This application will use a lot of the features we learned from the course and therefore I think it's

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.000
perfect to practice these things and see them come together in a real app.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.820
First of all though let's try to plan the application because before creating Yep you of course need

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.820
to have a plan and therefore in the next lecture we're going to think about which components we will

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.310
need for the different features of this application.
