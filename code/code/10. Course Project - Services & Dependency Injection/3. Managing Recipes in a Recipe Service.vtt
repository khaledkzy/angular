00:02.570 --> 00:06.410
What should our recipe servers do for us.

00:06.410 --> 00:13.760
I guess it makes sense if the recipes service is to place in our app where we manage our recipes therefore

00:14.030 --> 00:21.220
we should take our recipes which we currently manage and our recipe list and manage it in the recipes

00:21.220 --> 00:22.200
service.

00:22.220 --> 00:28.820
That's the first thing with which I'll start so simply copy it for now and add it as a property and

00:28.820 --> 00:30.200
the recipe service.

00:30.320 --> 00:35.480
Of course we now have to add the import pointing to the recipe model file which sits in the same folder

00:35.510 --> 00:37.040
as the service.

00:37.340 --> 00:45.140
So with that we get an array of recipes in the recipe service and I will actually make this private

00:45.230 --> 00:49.540
so that you can directly access this array from outside.

00:50.150 --> 00:56.390
Now with this added I also want to add I get recipe's method which will return this array so that we

00:56.390 --> 00:59.420
can get access to it from outside.

00:59.420 --> 01:06.320
If I were to return it like this I actually return the direct reference to this array.

01:06.470 --> 01:12.660
And since arrays and objects are reference types and Javascript so has nothing to do with angular but

01:12.660 --> 01:14.460
the javascript that is.

01:14.840 --> 01:20.660
Well if we now change something on desirÃ© we will change it on the array into service.

01:20.660 --> 01:24.420
Therefore I will called slice with no arguments.

01:24.510 --> 01:31.030
This will simply return a new array which is an exact copy of the one in disserves file.

01:31.100 --> 01:36.410
So therefore we really can't access your recipes stored here from outside.

01:36.410 --> 01:39.090
We only get a copy.

01:39.300 --> 01:43.740
So that is a way to get our recipes.

01:43.740 --> 01:48.440
Now with that we can and we have to add our service.

01:48.450 --> 01:55.950
Actually both services to a place and our app to provide them so that we can inject them where should

01:55.950 --> 02:05.090
we provide both services Well let's start with providing the recipe service in our recipe component.

02:05.230 --> 02:11.290
We can always put it somewhere else later if we recognize that we want access to it from a number part

02:11.290 --> 02:12.150
in our app.

02:12.460 --> 02:17.670
But for now our ad providers this IRET to the recipe component.

02:17.800 --> 02:23.920
Therefore this component and all Abdur recipe related components since they are all child components

02:23.920 --> 02:29.260
to this component in the end will share the same instance of the service but you won't be able to access

02:29.260 --> 02:34.530
the service or at least not the same instance in Abre components like the shopping list component.

02:34.810 --> 02:39.380
So here in providers I will list my recipe service.

02:39.460 --> 02:45.620
Of course you have to import at the top telling typescript where to find this type.

02:45.660 --> 02:51.280
Now with this we use our Or we can use our recipe service year.

02:51.300 --> 02:54.450
Now let's use it in the recipe list component.

02:55.180 --> 03:00.090
Here right now we already manage our recipe IRA.

03:00.340 --> 03:02.870
Now I don't want to do that here anymore.

03:02.980 --> 03:05.160
It will be undefined initially.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.240
We will get the value here in ngi on in it.

03:08.350 --> 03:14.500
And for this we need to inject our service and we can do that since we just provided it on the parent

03:14.500 --> 03:15.330
component.

03:15.340 --> 03:22.230
So here I will provide my recipe service which is of type recipe service.

03:22.360 --> 03:28.390
Of course make sure to import recipes service from the appropriate file and there should be private

03:28.600 --> 03:36.090
here to use those types of shortcut of instantly assigning a property with the same name and enjoyment

03:36.090 --> 03:36.480
in it.

03:36.480 --> 03:46.290
I can now say this recipe's equals this recipe servers get recipes and we will get a copy of recipes

03:46.290 --> 03:48.210
just copy of that array.

03:48.750 --> 03:55.800
Well let's see this in action if we save this we should and we do see the same as before.

03:55.810 --> 04:02.020
The app works just like before because the only thing we changed but now is where and how we manage

04:02.080 --> 04:04.010
our array of recipes.

04:04.060 --> 04:05.590
An important first step.
