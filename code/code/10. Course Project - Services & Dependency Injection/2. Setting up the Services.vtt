00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.060
So let's add some services manually.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.690
Now we should place the services next to the feature or in the folder holding the feature they belong

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.690
to you.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.480
So if we create a recipe service the recipes folder looks like a good place for it.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.550
So here I'll add a recipe service.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.550
And of course the file is named recipe dot service dot TS due to that and you're able to simply export

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.540
a class which is named recipe service.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.000
Remember a service simply is a type of class.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.790
You don't need to add any special decorator to it at least not if you don't plan on injecting a service

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.200
into the service.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.580
Well and the same for the shopping lists service.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.280
I'll place it in the shopping list folder here.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.050
I'll name a shopping list dot service Dot.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.080
Yes that's the file name.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.060
And then inside the file of course I'll export a class named shopping list service.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.720
So these are the two service files.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.710
Now let's start working on the recipe service for us.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.890
Let's start working on it in the next lecture.
