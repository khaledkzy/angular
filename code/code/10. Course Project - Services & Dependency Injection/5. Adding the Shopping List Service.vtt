00:02.580 --> 00:08.850
So in the last lectures we improved our recipes section a lot with the service.

00:08.880 --> 00:12.870
Now let's work on the shopping list side on the shopping list service.

00:12.990 --> 00:15.270
This service is empty right now.

00:15.570 --> 00:17.250
Now here's your challenge.

00:17.300 --> 00:25.560
For some life it would be nice if this service could manage our shopping lists or a list of ingredients.

00:25.560 --> 00:31.680
Maybe you even add the ADD ingredient method here so that you can add ingredients using the service

00:31.680 --> 00:32.280
too.

00:32.280 --> 00:36.340
We already got this add functionality here in the shopping list component.

00:36.600 --> 00:42.520
It shouldn't live here anymore though and with debt we would take a huge step forward.

00:42.540 --> 00:48.150
So your chance to pause the video and try this on your own thereafter we'll solve it together.

00:50.570 --> 00:52.590
So were you successful.

00:52.730 --> 00:56.510
Let's fill this shopping service with some live.

00:56.720 --> 01:02.690
Four days out first of all copy my ingredients here and add it here as a property to the service.

01:02.750 --> 01:09.100
And of course a need to import ingredient from the shared folder from the ingredient model there.

01:09.140 --> 01:15.600
Now with that we got the data in here and I will make it as private now just like in their shopping

01:15.680 --> 01:17.800
excuse me in the recipe service.

01:18.050 --> 01:27.440
I will add I get ingredients method here where I will return my ingredients but only a copy of it with

01:27.440 --> 01:34.420
the slice method so that I can't access the original aere stored in the service.

01:34.480 --> 01:41.140
With that I can go back to my shopping list component and I will set this to an uninitialized property

01:42.240 --> 01:45.830
but I can inject my shopping list service.

01:45.840 --> 01:51.210
Now again the question is Where should be provided now for now.

01:51.360 --> 01:57.150
We can provide it here in the shopping list component and therefore it would all be available in the

01:57.150 --> 02:04.970
shopping added component but actually later I also want to access it from my recipe section.

02:04.970 --> 02:15.480
That is why I will actually provided an app module and here I will add it to disk providers or for shopping

02:15.540 --> 02:17.290
list service.

02:17.310 --> 02:21.570
Make sure to also add to import at the top of your.

02:21.770 --> 02:28.910
So now we will be able to use a service application wide including in other services and I exactly need

02:28.910 --> 02:33.420
this behavior because we will soon use it in an average service.

02:33.470 --> 02:39.910
So back to the shopping list component then we can now injector shopping the service and will bind a

02:39.920 --> 02:42.290
to a property named s.l service.

02:42.290 --> 02:47.840
Of course you can choose a different name which will be of type shopping list service and you need to

02:47.840 --> 02:50.230
add the import pointing to the shopping list.

02:50.260 --> 02:58.280
That service file with that an engine in it because you should do all tasks which required a bit more

02:58.340 --> 03:01.310
heavy lifting or in general as a good practice.

03:01.340 --> 03:04.830
All initializations in N-G on in it.

03:04.880 --> 03:12.040
Therefore here I will simply assign my ingredients to whatever the shopping service returns me.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.870
If I call get ingredients here.

03:15.320 --> 03:20.720
With this in place if we save this and we go to a shopping list area this is still working so that's

03:20.720 --> 03:21.770
great.

03:21.770 --> 03:27.950
Now let's make sure that we can also add items so add the ADD ingredient

03:30.640 --> 03:38.320
method to your and I know that I will receive an ingredient here of type ingredient and all I want to

03:38.320 --> 03:44.440
do then is I want to access my ingredients and push this new ingredient on it.

03:44.440 --> 03:51.000
So your ingredient Now if we go to the shopping added component.

03:51.260 --> 03:57.560
Right now we're emitting and even with our own ingredient we no longer need to do this so we can get

03:57.560 --> 04:02.640
rid of the event of output and of the imports you're related to this.

04:02.840 --> 04:09.200
We can also go to the shopping component h team l file and remove our listener where we listen to this

04:09.200 --> 04:14.810
event and any shopping list component types could follow we can get rid of the on ingredient added method

04:14.840 --> 04:17.570
because we'll now do this in the service.

04:17.570 --> 04:23.180
So back to shopping at a component where we create a new ingredient here I want to use the service and

04:23.180 --> 04:29.350
for this I will exercise my service so I will inject s l service here.

04:30.330 --> 04:31.410
Like this.

04:31.560 --> 04:36.810
Make sure to add to import of course enden on an item.

04:36.810 --> 04:41.380
I'll add s.l service and add an ingredient to it.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.340
This new ingredient here.

04:44.340 --> 04:53.680
Now if we save this and now try adding a new item here bread one we don't see it but we also don't get

04:53.740 --> 04:55.430
an error.

04:55.560 --> 05:01.990
Now there is something wrong here and we will find out what and fix it in the next lecture.
