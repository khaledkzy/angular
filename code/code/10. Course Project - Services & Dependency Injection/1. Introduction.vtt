00:02.490 --> 00:04.480
Welcome back to the recipe project.

00:04.770 --> 00:07.420
We already added a lot of features to it.

00:07.440 --> 00:15.040
Now it's time to add services to it which will give us the possibility to greatly enhance this project.

00:15.630 --> 00:18.370
Which services do we need.

00:18.910 --> 00:21.060
Let's have a look at our application again.

00:21.150 --> 00:25.170
This is the application the way it looks right now.

00:25.200 --> 00:32.890
Now services allow us to centralize tasks manage data in a central place and so on.

00:32.910 --> 00:39.360
So we probably need a service for both feature areas we will need a shopping list service and a recipe

00:39.360 --> 00:45.930
service the shopping list service managing well our shopping list and we will all access it from the

00:45.930 --> 00:50.890
recipe from the recipe area because we want to add items to the shopping list from there.

00:51.120 --> 00:58.080
And well the recipe servers that will be responsible for managing our recipes managing the data there

00:58.110 --> 00:59.120
and so on.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.420
So we'll use both services.

01:01.530 --> 01:10.260
And as always the challenge for you create both services for now only create the files and try to find

01:10.410 --> 01:13.860
places in our abstract where they just fit in.

01:14.110 --> 01:16.960
And thereafter we will fill them with some live together.

01:17.040 --> 01:21.570
So let's start together in the next section try to create these files on your own
