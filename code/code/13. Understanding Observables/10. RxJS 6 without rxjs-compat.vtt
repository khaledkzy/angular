00:02.820 --> 00:06.320
So it is the application we built in this module.

00:06.360 --> 00:11.360
Now it's working fine but it's working fine because of our extra Yes compact.

00:11.370 --> 00:13.210
Now let's get rid of that.

00:13.620 --> 00:23.910
Let's stop our server and let's also install there with NPM uninstalled dash dash save our x yes compact

00:24.130 --> 00:29.760
so this will now really get rid of this package or remove it from our node modules folder so that really

00:29.820 --> 00:31.780
isn't available anymore.

00:32.220 --> 00:39.230
Now once it is completed if we now try to run ngi serve you will see that it will actually fail.

00:40.340 --> 00:43.650
It will start building bad.

00:43.670 --> 00:45.250
We got an error.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.210
Now we can fix this.

00:47.210 --> 00:52.490
We can use our ex-chief as Version 6 without that extra package for it as we just need to adjust our

00:52.490 --> 00:57.590
imports and we have to keep this in mind for the rest of the course because these imports always have

00:57.590 --> 00:59.270
to be adjusted as seen.

00:59.330 --> 01:06.530
Well now in the user service for example where we import subject from our exchange subject we import

01:06.560 --> 01:08.400
subject from just our.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.270
Yes that's all you omit.

01:10.310 --> 01:12.260
Slash subject.

01:12.260 --> 01:21.830
Now in our home component where we import a couple of things from our exchange packages we import observable

01:22.010 --> 01:31.900
from our exchange as we import our observer from our exchanges and we import subscription from our exchanges.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.290
We can also get rid of these two lines set forth.

01:34.330 --> 01:41.110
So the general idea is you always remove the slash something ofter our exchanges and import it directly

01:41.110 --> 01:45.040
from our exchanges and you do this for the entire course of course.

01:45.100 --> 01:51.230
Now regarding this second imports where we unlocked the operators we actually also have to change this

01:51.640 --> 01:52.100
there.

01:52.180 --> 01:59.230
We clearly specify which operator we want to import like map and we do it as from our exchange as Slash

01:59.350 --> 02:00.080
operators.

02:00.090 --> 02:07.540
Now now with this important we also have to change the way we call this operator.

02:07.630 --> 02:10.990
We don't call map directly on the observable.

02:10.990 --> 02:21.410
Instead we use a special Meffert the pipe method and we pass map just like that into pipe.

02:21.460 --> 02:26.610
So the map function with its argument is passed into pipe just like that.

02:26.620 --> 02:29.260
And you do does with any operator you use.

02:29.490 --> 02:32.640
So the pipe simply allows you to pipe multiple operators.

02:33.160 --> 02:37.630
Now when everything we have to do is the interval method and this is really only important for this

02:37.630 --> 02:44.170
module because we never use it again in this course you rarely create observables yourself but the interval

02:44.170 --> 02:48.570
Meffert also is simply directly imported from our X-Trace.

02:48.580 --> 02:53.240
So we import interval here and we can omit absorbable therefore.

02:53.530 --> 03:01.110
Now with that if we save does all we can restart and serve.

03:01.330 --> 03:06.540
And now it should actually compile successfully.

03:06.570 --> 03:08.430
So as you see there's no works.

03:08.530 --> 03:12.480
And if we reload Yapp we see the logs as before.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.220
So now we're using our exchange 6 only.

03:15.270 --> 03:22.500
And as you see the upgrade was as simple as using pipe for operators and in general adjusting the imports.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.350
Keep this in mind for the rest of the course.

03:24.390 --> 03:30.080
If you don't want to use t r x yes compact package does the only adjustment which is needed.

03:30.270 --> 03:31.960
And with that you should be fine.
