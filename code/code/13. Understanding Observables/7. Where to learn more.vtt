00:02.740 --> 00:08.000
So in last lectures we always had a closer look at observables how to create them and that unsubscribing

00:08.000 --> 00:09.180
is very important.

00:09.410 --> 00:13.160
Now I'm on the official documentation of the our access package.

00:13.190 --> 00:13.850
You can find it.

00:13.860 --> 00:20.720
Add re-active X dot I O slash r x chase and here if you click on observable you'll find much more ways

00:20.720 --> 00:22.230
of creating observables.

00:22.430 --> 00:26.910
We saw create and we also saw interval.

00:27.050 --> 00:33.260
But as you can see you can also create an observable often accessing promise or you can trade off an

00:33.260 --> 00:34.840
event and much more.

00:35.060 --> 00:37.330
So this is the place where you can dive deeper.

00:37.460 --> 00:40.330
As I said you can create a whole course about that.

00:40.370 --> 00:42.790
And that's not the goal of this course section.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.590
I only want to give you a brief overview.

00:45.590 --> 00:49.310
You can see that this library also has a couple of our objects.

00:49.580 --> 00:52.690
Well we had a look at the subscription to subscriber.

00:52.700 --> 00:57.680
As I said Iris's package all really functions you passed to subscribe.

00:57.800 --> 01:02.060
We have the observer interface but there are other packages too.

01:02.420 --> 01:09.550
I will have a look at the subject and we'll have a look at another cool feature of the X shares package.

01:09.590 --> 01:18.470
It's many many operators It offers it offers a lot of operators you can add to your observable to transform

01:18.470 --> 01:20.460
the data you get back.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.730
And this is something we will use later in the HD section bit but there are so many.

01:25.790 --> 01:29.640
It's definitely worth its own lecture here in this section.
