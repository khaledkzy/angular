00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.300
So with this we had a little bit of a closer look at observables.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.570
Now this is only scratching the surface as you can see in the official documentation.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.530
There are a lot of features I didn't cover here a lot of operators.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.700
And we also got some of the objects here for example the average subjects here are some variations of

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.700
the subject we already used for example subjects which start with a starting value which the default

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.020
subject doesn't.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.200
Does something you absolutely should dive into on your own or with some records or tutorial if you're

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.790
interested in.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.920
If you are working with angler only you might not need to create your own observables.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.410
But in this case it's still important to understand how they generally work what happens behind the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:55.180
scenes and where to go if you need some extra operators if you want to set up your age to the request

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.050
observable in a certain way that you return data gets transformed.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.980
Something we will see THAAD P.S. or dad use send the rick retried who sent the request or something

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.070
like this.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.910
Chances are there is operator which he helps you with that and therefore it definitely should dive deeper

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.770
into this documentation.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.870
If you got any other questions connected to observables with that let's move on.
