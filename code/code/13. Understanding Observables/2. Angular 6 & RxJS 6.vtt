00:02.520 --> 00:07.520
This module will have a look at our X J.S. because angular uses this library a lot.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.840
And it's important to understand how it works.

00:10.170 --> 00:15.540
Now starting with Anglo-German 6 and you can check which word in your project is using any packaged

00:15.590 --> 00:21.620
adjacent fall starting with the words an angler uses are ex-GI s words and six.

00:21.620 --> 00:27.720
Now the two libraries are generally not connected but in some way they are angular uses to a lot.

00:27.720 --> 00:34.800
Now starting with our next guest worked in six DS syntax you use our x yes differs slightly and at the

00:34.800 --> 00:37.960
end of this module all show you how to easily update.

00:38.100 --> 00:43.200
We're not so much talking about the general features Sendak's but about how you import things.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.670
This is why a single VDU at the end of this module will suffice.

00:46.710 --> 00:49.770
The way you use observables doesn't change at all.

00:50.130 --> 00:55.470
Now you still use that older way of importing things which you'll see from the course.

00:55.530 --> 01:01.560
You simply need to install one additional package with NPM install dash dash save our x.

01:01.590 --> 01:03.520
Yes Dasch compact.

01:03.780 --> 01:10.410
Now our ex-chief Yes dash compact will unlock all the old imports in Texas you see in those cores and

01:10.410 --> 01:15.310
they will ensure that all of the code you see works exactly as you see it on the screen.

01:15.480 --> 01:21.270
If you want to work without that package again at the end of this module I will show you how to get

01:21.270 --> 01:24.730
rid of it and use that modern new imports index.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.500
But now let's dive into our exchange.

01:26.520 --> 01:31.620
Because the way this works and the way we have to think about it didn't change a bit.
