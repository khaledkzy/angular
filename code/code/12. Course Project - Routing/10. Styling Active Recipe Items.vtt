In the last lecture we made our child rattlings here work again.

00:06.660 --> 00:16.520
Now let's make clear which one is selected by marking it we can mark the active link by adding manually.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.040
The act of class to it.

00:19.250 --> 00:24.470
If we do this all are marked as active because of course it's added to every instance of this component

00:24.470 --> 00:26.510
because they hardcoded it in there.

00:26.930 --> 00:28.090
So that's the right class.

00:28.100 --> 00:34.420
But of course we should add a dynamically with good old router link act of directive and your assembly

00:34.430 --> 00:40.210
want to pass active asked a class name because we just saw this is to see us as class we need to add.

00:40.460 --> 00:45.040
And with that it's working as expected and that is all we needed to hear.

00:45.050 --> 00:51.020
You also see that recipe's is still marked as active at the top because we still are at slasher recipes

00:51.230 --> 00:56.630
and then adult child wrote but that doesn't matter for this to be marked as active because it's not

00:56.630 --> 00:58.450
set to exact matching.

00:58.460 --> 01:03.420
And actually we want to be able we have right now so that all looks pretty good.

01:03.440 --> 01:09.920
Now we can move on to make sure that we can click this new recipe button and this added recipe button

01:10.130 --> 01:11.510
and actually do something.

01:11.510 --> 01:12.640
Once we do click them
