00:02.470 --> 00:08.500
In the last lecture we started adding our child routes and now loading the recipe detail component doesn't

00:08.500 --> 00:09.720
work any more.

00:09.880 --> 00:15.330
The reason for this is that each year we use recipe all over the place and that's a property of this

00:15.340 --> 00:16.190
component.

00:16.390 --> 00:21.100
But it's a property set Frue property binding with at inport in front of it.

00:21.100 --> 00:25.270
So it awaits to be set from outside the component.

00:25.510 --> 00:30.220
Since this component is set for routing though this won't work anymore.

00:30.280 --> 00:36.900
So we have to change how we received the recipe here or how we set the recipe and we can change it.

00:36.910 --> 00:45.070
Because keep in mind in our route which we define here we pass this idea which is a dynamic parameter

00:45.520 --> 00:53.770
so we should be able to load a recipe by the ID which will simply refer to the position in the array

00:53.770 --> 00:55.540
of recipes.

00:55.540 --> 00:57.290
So here is your challenge.

00:57.430 --> 01:05.950
Try fixing the recipe detail a component to somehow use that ID to update the recipe which is displayed

01:06.100 --> 01:08.810
to fetch it from the recipe service.

01:08.830 --> 01:13.820
Of course you will need to implement some method in the recipe service which allows you to get that.

01:14.060 --> 01:19.620
Here's your chance to pause the video there after i will solve it together with you.

01:23.420 --> 01:25.100
So where are you successful.

01:25.130 --> 01:28.930
Let's fix that together into recipe detail component.

01:28.970 --> 01:33.480
We clearly can remove an input because that's not how we receive the value anymore.

01:33.590 --> 01:37.160
So we can also remove the import of input.

01:37.340 --> 01:43.710
That of course also means before we forget it then the rest of the item component we can remove the

01:43.720 --> 01:49.870
on selected click listener here because that will not be how we passed the value anymore.

01:50.270 --> 01:53.640
And of course we could also remove the on select that method here.

01:53.710 --> 01:59.090
That that's something we don't need anymore of course that also allows us to remove the recipes service

01:59.090 --> 02:01.280
from this component and remove the import.

02:01.340 --> 02:05.850
So we're cleaning up quite a lot here in the recipe list component.

02:05.870 --> 02:07.880
We don't have to change anything.

02:07.910 --> 02:13.650
And then the recipe component itself here we already did make a change and add the router outlet.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.670
So now any recipe detail a component we somehow need to get our single recipe and we know that we will

02:19.670 --> 02:22.170
get the idea from the router.

02:22.460 --> 02:29.540
So let's first fetch this ID and you learned that for this we need to get access to the activated route.

02:29.720 --> 02:33.710
So let's inject it here of Taieb actuated route.

02:33.890 --> 02:42.470
Make sure to add this import here from at angular router this import is important to an able typescript

02:42.470 --> 02:44.890
to identify the type you are trying to inject here.

02:44.890 --> 02:47.170
And with that angular is able to use it.

02:47.420 --> 02:53.600
So now we get this route and now we have two ways of retrieving the ID.

02:53.630 --> 02:59.380
The first one would be to simply bind it to route snap.

02:59.390 --> 03:10.840
Excuse me this route snapshot Perens ID but this will only work for the first time we load a detail

03:10.830 --> 03:11.900
a component.

03:12.270 --> 03:19.410
Now keep in mind D-men you where we can click on one is on the left so we will be able to choose a new

03:19.410 --> 03:20.310
recipe.

03:20.370 --> 03:27.450
Whilst we still see the details of number one so we probably want to react to changes in our recipe

03:27.500 --> 03:30.560
ID because that's absolutely possible in our app.

03:30.870 --> 03:33.880
So that is not the approach I want to use.

03:34.050 --> 03:41.850
Instead what I want to do is I want to use my route the parents observable and subscribe to that observable.

03:41.850 --> 03:48.760
Now with that we can react to any changes in our roud parents and we will get them here of type parents.

03:48.780 --> 03:57.860
As we learned to be imported from an angle or router and now now we can really react to a new ID.

03:58.260 --> 04:03.300
So we should probably store that ID here in a property of our class.

04:03.330 --> 04:12.600
It will be of type number so we should set this ID equals you harems ID though we know that what we

04:12.600 --> 04:15.180
get back here will be a string.

04:15.210 --> 04:19.080
So we should costed it to a number by adding a plus in front of it.

04:19.350 --> 04:26.400
So now we will have an ID in the form of a number which we can use to identify our recipe.

04:27.030 --> 04:29.540
Well with this information.

04:29.880 --> 04:35.550
We want to load our recipe from the recipe service and for that we need to change our recipe service

04:35.550 --> 04:43.050
because right now weve got no way of loading a single recipe by ID that's something we can easily implement

04:43.050 --> 04:51.180
though we can simply implement a get recipe method which takes an idea of type number and then we can

04:51.180 --> 04:57.070
simply return this recipes and select the item at this index.

04:57.070 --> 05:02.680
We could also rename ID to index to make really clear what that number will be in the end.

05:03.560 --> 05:11.780
You could also call slice before doing that because slice would now give you a copy of your array though

05:11.840 --> 05:14.260
it won't be a deep copy.

05:14.300 --> 05:20.790
So the objects still are the same anyways so you can also do directly return the object like this.

05:20.810 --> 05:26.720
You could of course also create a hard copy of that object with object aside for example.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.070
That's not what I want to do here though.

05:28.070 --> 05:30.480
So we return a single recipe.

05:30.500 --> 05:37.640
Now back in the recipe detail component typescript file after fetching an idea and storing it I went

05:37.640 --> 05:40.070
to fetch didn't you recipe.

05:40.340 --> 05:49.020
And I will later also show why I needed to store the ID here so let's fetch the recipe using our recipe

05:49.020 --> 05:57.410
service whenever the idea changes then I will call get recipe and pass my ID as an argument and with

05:57.410 --> 06:06.420
that we should be able to indeed make our application to work again by going manually to recipes zero.

06:06.740 --> 06:09.350
We indeed see the detail view.

06:09.380 --> 06:10.780
For dishnet all.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.390
And with one for the burger.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.920
So that is working.

06:14.930 --> 06:19.820
Now we also need to enable these links here to work again because right now they're not doing anything
