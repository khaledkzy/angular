00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.010
So we added our routes for the edit component.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.980
Now let's go to that component and retrieve the ID and therefore determine whether we are in edit mode

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.480
or not.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:21.610
I will inject de-activated route in there as you learn before from an angler router and an engine in

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.230
it.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.050
This is a good place to now retrieve d id ask before I want to do this dynamically.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.730
So I will use my route and the parables observable and subscribe to that.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.080
And here I will receive my parents which are of type parents and here I don't want to retrieve the ID

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.510
on which I'm currently working.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.500
I will store the ID here in a property named or not named named ID but of type number.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:59.380
So so here will set this ID equal to plus to converted into a number Perens ID because that's the name

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.200
of our dynamic parameter in our route's it up right.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.150
With that we retrieve that ID here.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.850
But I also want to find out whether I'm editing the recipe or creating a new one.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.180
I actually want to store does information in a new property added mode.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.700
Maybe also that to fall initially.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.370
So initially could say we assume that we are creating a new recipe.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.360
We are not in edit mode.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.170
Now I will check this whenever the parameters change.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.080
Then I will assign a new value to edit mode.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.430
And here I will simply assign the value of the following check.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.470
I want to see if parens has an id property so if it has one then this will actually be a string with

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.720
the ID otherwise it will be undefined.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.770
So by comparing it to null and checking if it is not null I'm checking.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:02.050
Does it have the ID because parents and that their ID ID will only be not undefined if we are in edit

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.700
mode because then an idea will be present.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.150
If this check returns true.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.380
So if the ID indeed is undefined and therefore equal to null This will return false because I'm checking

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.820
the opposite and therefore we are in new mode and we can check this by simply logging it in the console

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.080
here added mode.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.690
Let's see if this works we're at 0 edit your and it returns true.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.370
And now we're at new Android returns false.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.690
So that seems to work.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.140
This is a nice way of checking in which mode we are.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.250
So if we are able to retrieve the idea of the element we want to edit and to find out whether we are

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.060
in an edit mode or not.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.310
Now I want to make this added link your work and a new recipe link because these are both things which

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.870
are not working as of now.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.800
Let's work on this next.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.070
And actually this is a nice challenge for you make these links work.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:08.140
Make sure that when we click this link or this button we get taken to the recipe's new page or the recipes

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.680
edit page for their respective recipe we had loaded.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.350
It's a nice challenge for you in the next lecture we can view my solution to Gebre
