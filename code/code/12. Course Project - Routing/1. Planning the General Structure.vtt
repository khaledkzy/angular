00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.030
Well I come back to the Recipe Book.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.660
Now that we learned about routeing in the last course section it's time to add it to our recipe book

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.020
course app.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.020
This is the structure of our app thus far and we already get a lot of components and so on.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.940
Right now we implemented the navigation our application with ngi if though and that is not really the

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.000
best way of navigating around.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.880
Instead I want to use the Eyler router to load pages and to allow the user to well switch between pages

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.960
in this section.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.920
However we will not only add the router We will also add one new component the recipe added component

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.560
because now that we have a way of loading different pages.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.420
We can also add this to component which we will fill with some life after the form section this course

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.520
which will then allow us to create new recipes or edit existing ones.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.460
So once you set up a routing and this section and we definitely need routes to load either to a shopping

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.090
list or a recipe book.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.310
But inside of the Recipe Book section of the app I want to have some child Rochlitz targeting the recipe

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.710
detail or recipe added component.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.040
These components which will always be loaded on the left side of our list of recipes should be loaded

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.320
dynamically on only one of the tools should be loaded at a time.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.070
Therefore child routing.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.580
So that is the general structure.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.470
Let's now put this into practice and build our application at routing to it.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.170
Starting in the next lecture
