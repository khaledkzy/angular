In the last lecture we added navigation and we are now able to switch between our pages here.

00:07.870 --> 00:09.280
That's great.

00:09.280 --> 00:16.570
Now I want to mark the active route and actually bootstrap the C S S remember we're using guess as a

00:16.570 --> 00:22.790
class to Mark DIAK to for all that if we add this class to the list item which holds the link.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.950
It's the act of class there.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.140
If we save this now does the smartest active.

00:28.240 --> 00:34.060
Of course it doesn't change because they are hard coded into there but this is the class we dynamically

00:34.060 --> 00:35.140
need to add.

00:35.590 --> 00:37.420
Well and you learned how to do this.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.670
We got a helpful directive for this.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.030
The router link act of directive.

00:42.160 --> 00:47.000
Here we simply define the class we want to conditionally attach to this element.

00:47.150 --> 00:52.650
Whenever the link on this element or nested inside of it like it's to case your it gets active.

00:52.810 --> 00:56.310
So here that would be the act of class as we just saw.

00:56.500 --> 00:58.520
And the same of course for shopping list.

00:58.660 --> 01:02.420
So Radlick active should also be placed on this one.

01:02.650 --> 01:08.260
And with this you see it's still active but now it switches because now this is as class gets applied

01:08.440 --> 01:09.810
to the correct route.

01:09.940 --> 01:11.380
So that's not working.

01:11.440 --> 01:17.520
With that let's make sure that when I click a recipe here we don't actually reload the app as we do.

01:17.530 --> 01:24.370
Now if you watch this reload icon next to the browser your L bar that happens because we have this ref

01:24.400 --> 01:25.500
element on it.

01:25.630 --> 01:28.780
So we will fix this and then think about the next steps of our app
