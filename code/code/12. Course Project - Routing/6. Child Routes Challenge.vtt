As I mentioned at the end of the last lecture the next goal is to implement child routing for our recipe

00:08.310 --> 00:15.040
Routier so that when we click a recipe here we actually loaded by adding let's say slash and then the

00:15.040 --> 00:22.150
idea of that recipe and our recipes array your indie your Elle's recipes one would load the first element

00:22.180 --> 00:26.800
or recipes 0 actually since we started 0 in the array and so on.

00:26.800 --> 00:31.550
So that would be great if we could load our recipes like that and render them here then.

00:31.570 --> 00:36.980
So we have a child rowdier again and the same for new recipe and edit.

00:37.090 --> 00:39.240
But for that we will need a new component.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.920
Let's implement this in a second step.

00:41.920 --> 00:48.400
The first step should be to make these items clickable and load the detail component as a child route.

00:48.410 --> 00:55.720
Here in New router outlet probably we will also need another new component then for the case that we

00:55.720 --> 00:57.230
first visit our page.

00:57.250 --> 01:02.680
In this case we should have a starting component which kind of says Please select a recipe something

01:02.680 --> 01:09.400
we right now do by displaying this template here in our recipes component here DNG template.

01:09.460 --> 01:15.550
But Dad will then also be removed because all I want to have inside of this div with the call M.D 7

01:15.550 --> 01:15.980
class.

01:15.980 --> 01:18.550
Here is our router outlet.

01:18.550 --> 01:20.430
So again this is a challenge for you.

01:20.440 --> 01:26.180
Try implementing this child routeing or at least try to do this first steps off dead.

01:26.200 --> 01:32.240
Setting up the router creating that component which basically says Please select a recipe and then loading

01:32.260 --> 01:38.440
either dead component or a detail route the detail component depending on whether we click the recipe

01:38.440 --> 01:39.530
the list or not.

01:39.550 --> 01:44.410
Certainly a challenge but also something where you can practice a lot of the things we learned in the

01:44.410 --> 01:47.580
last lectures starting in the next lecture.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.020
We will do it together.

01:49.060 --> 01:51.990
So then you can see my approach on implementing this
