00:02.300 --> 00:06.040
And The Last Lecture we styled our active links here.

00:06.060 --> 00:10.950
Now I want to fix the behavior that whenever I click one of these recipes I can see where we reload

00:10.950 --> 00:11.760
the page.

00:12.030 --> 00:18.240
And that simply happens if we have a look at our recipe list component which of course is responsible

00:18.240 --> 00:24.490
for displaying the list here in the recipe item which is the individual items we're clicking.

00:24.510 --> 00:27.320
We have a link with this ref attribute here.

00:27.450 --> 00:33.640
Let's remove it because Dad will actually send the request to the browser and therefore reload our page.

00:33.870 --> 00:36.830
If we remove this you'll see now I can click it.

00:36.930 --> 00:40.980
But now we no longer get to cursor which looks like a hand.

00:41.490 --> 00:47.820
We can quickly add this manually though by simply adding style and then Kirsner equal to pointer.

00:47.880 --> 00:52.050
And now we should have the pointer which clearly indicates that we can click this.

00:52.370 --> 00:55.280
But now we don't reload the page anymore.

00:55.590 --> 01:00.840
Now for the drop down here we should also make sure that all these links are not reloading the page

01:00.930 --> 01:07.020
because right now they are and that is something we have to fix in the recipe detail a component here.

01:07.020 --> 01:14.730
We also need to remove DS ref elements here and I already added the style with the cursor which is set

01:14.730 --> 01:17.240
to a pointer to the first anchor tag.

01:17.400 --> 01:21.490
Let's also add it to the average Q And with that that should be fixed too.

01:21.750 --> 01:24.360
Now if we select something here we don't reload.

01:24.660 --> 01:30.110
Let's not do that for the dropdown right now clicking the dropdown also reloads the page.

01:30.150 --> 01:32.880
That of course has to be fixed in the hetero component.

01:33.090 --> 01:41.050
And here we reload the page because our dropdown also has this anchor tag or this ref attribute on it.

01:41.250 --> 01:48.300
So we should get rid of this and then maybe also implement this style Kirsner pointer set up to get

01:48.300 --> 01:49.730
the right mouse cursor.

01:49.920 --> 01:55.470
Let's also do the same for the individual and cortex inside of that dropdown.

01:55.560 --> 01:59.640
So I also removed ref there and added my own curses style.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.060
So with that this not all works fine.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.170
Of course the problem doesn't do anything.

02:04.170 --> 02:10.980
We'll add this later but the app is working again and therefore we made a big step into the right direction.

02:10.980 --> 02:19.680
So with this all added and set up here our route routes seem to be working fine but now I want to change

02:19.680 --> 02:25.930
the way we follow the recipe when we click on one here in the last I actually want to load dead.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.480
Why a child routing when you click new recipe.

02:29.490 --> 02:36.840
I also want to load the tube created recipe edit component here on the right where we now have the detail

02:36.840 --> 02:40.790
component and the same for the case that we click Edit here.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.640
So that is something I definitely want to add.

02:43.770 --> 02:46.070
I want to add these routes.

02:46.100 --> 02:46.960
Child Rodd's.

02:46.980 --> 02:49.210
So that is what we should work on next.
