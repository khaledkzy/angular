00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.100
In the last lecture we added routeing we set up our routes for this application and we can load them

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.990
but the links are not working as expected so we should fix this with our main routes set up.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.650
We can go to the head of a component and here I want to change the way we navigate.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.580
I no longer need to click listeners here.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.700
And also I don't need ref elements so we should remove that so that our app doesn't reload because right

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.170
now if you click the links it will simply send the request to the server and reload the page.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.980
So remove that and I can also remove the on select Meffert here and remove the event emitter the header

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.570
component.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.520
So basically all that killed all of the imports and now we can simply use router link.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.670
And here I want to create an absolute link to slash her recipes and for the shopping list here I will

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.560
create an absolute link to slash shopping list.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.330
And of course you could also use that alternative syntax taught in the last lectures and the last course

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.530
section actually where you would enclose roud link into square brackets and then you would pass an array

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.370
between the double quotation marks here to configure the individual segments of your path.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.920
But since you're all I want is to go to these root routes there is no need to do so.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.010
And that is the quickest way of setting up our paths here.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.030
So with that if we saved us we should already see that navigation is working again and that is that's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.050
great.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.180
But I also want to mark the active route here.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.740
So that's what I'll work on in the next lecture
