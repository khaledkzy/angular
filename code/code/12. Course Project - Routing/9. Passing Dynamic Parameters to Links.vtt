With our child routes at it and The Last Lecture Let's now make these links work again so that we can

00:09.040 --> 00:16.960
really choose an item from that list the place to make these links work of course is our recipe list

00:17.440 --> 00:18.900
the recipe item here.

00:18.970 --> 00:23.080
That is where we have the anchor tag and that is where we should set the link.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.880
We can set a link with Routier link.

00:26.140 --> 00:29.300
But now we get a dynamic segment in the path.

00:29.530 --> 00:36.730
So now I will bind Routier link with square brackets because now I want to pass this array which allows

00:36.730 --> 00:41.320
me to really configure a segment for a segment of my pov.

00:41.560 --> 00:48.270
Now the first segment is also the only segment that will be the ideal one to load.

00:48.280 --> 00:56.460
So I will use a relative path because this element here the list already is loaded at slash recipes.

00:56.680 --> 01:02.500
So whenever I just add the idea here that is already all in one because then we're going to end up at

01:02.500 --> 01:04.410
recipes slash ID.

01:04.480 --> 01:11.030
Now to get the ID I need to pass this extra information to the recipe item component.

01:11.050 --> 01:14.510
We're not doing this right now so let's do that.

01:14.530 --> 01:20.520
I will add a new property binding here so I will add the index here.

01:21.600 --> 01:27.270
And the index will simply be a number and I will add at input at the beginning.

01:27.690 --> 01:34.230
With this I can now pass in the index of this item from outside and I'll do it from the recipe list

01:34.230 --> 01:38.720
component here besides sending the recipe itself.

01:39.030 --> 01:45.090
I can also pass the index and of course I have to retrieve that from my ends you for loop.

01:45.210 --> 01:52.530
So here I'll simply bind I to index to get the index of the while of each iteration basically and then

01:52.530 --> 01:59.450
I'll pass this index to the recipe item and bind it to the index property there.

01:59.550 --> 02:05.410
This property would just create it as a side note with the idea being passed to those component.

02:05.420 --> 02:12.120
Now you feel radically could update this component to now use our recipe service and get recipe method.

02:12.120 --> 02:18.600
We just created two fetched a recipe by ID but I will leave it as it is here but that would be one way

02:18.600 --> 02:21.900
of refactoring or restructuring this component.

02:21.900 --> 02:28.200
The important thing for us now is that we have the index property in this component now and that is

02:28.230 --> 02:30.110
all we need for this link.

02:30.300 --> 02:35.110
So I want to pass the index here and keep in mind this is for a single component.

02:35.160 --> 02:39.510
So that index will be different for each instance of this component.

02:39.510 --> 02:44.480
So if we save this we can see it already at the bottom of the page.

02:44.480 --> 02:48.960
Does looks all right and they can switch between 0 and 1.

02:49.180 --> 02:51.370
So that looks pretty good.

02:51.380 --> 02:57.460
Now it would also be nice to style the active item here though and that is something I'll do in the

02:57.460 --> 02:58.260
next lecture
