In last lectures we added a lot of routing functionality to our app.

00:06.660 --> 00:08.560
It's looking pretty good.

00:08.580 --> 00:11.410
We get all the main pieces tied together.

00:11.640 --> 00:17.880
One thing I want to bring to your attention again is we are subscribing to parents year into detail

00:17.880 --> 00:20.850
component and then the added component.

00:20.850 --> 00:27.300
Now as I explained you don't need to clean up the subscription here I just want to bring it to your

00:27.300 --> 00:28.670
attention again.

00:28.710 --> 00:35.930
In other cases where you use your own observables observables you created and not managed by angler.

00:35.940 --> 00:39.740
Therefore you will need to clean up the subscription.

00:39.870 --> 00:45.020
So definitely keep that in mind if you work with your own observables here for now.

00:45.090 --> 00:49.600
We can simply proceed with the set up and let angler do the cleanup work
