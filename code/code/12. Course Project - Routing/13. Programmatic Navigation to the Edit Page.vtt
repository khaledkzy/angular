00:02.420 --> 00:05.130
So why are you successful hooking up these buttons.

00:05.210 --> 00:06.950
Let's do it together.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.640
I want to start with the new recipe button.

00:09.830 --> 00:17.510
And for that I'll give you my recipe list component which is where I have this button here and I simply

00:17.510 --> 00:24.150
want to add a click listener to it on new recipe could be a fitting name.

00:24.290 --> 00:29.150
So let's copy that name and add it to our typescript code so that here we have the method which will

00:29.150 --> 00:30.060
get triggered.

00:30.110 --> 00:34.190
And now I need to inject the router to be able to navigate to this route.

00:34.190 --> 00:43.850
I want to go to so I'll add my router a year of Taieb router to be imported from at angular router here.

00:43.850 --> 00:46.240
So all ADD does import.

00:46.750 --> 00:49.150
And what's that an on new recipe.

00:49.150 --> 00:56.780
I simply want to target or use my router to use to navigate Mefford to target this POV.

00:56.800 --> 01:03.310
I want to go to you now which Parvis that we already are on slash recipes here.

01:03.310 --> 01:09.850
Keep this in mind because your on the recipe list so I can use a relative route and simply add new to

01:09.850 --> 01:10.320
it.

01:10.390 --> 01:16.300
Now to be able to use a relative route in the navigate method though we also need to inform the router

01:16.300 --> 01:25.440
about our current route so let's inject this to here the route of course of type activated route needs

01:25.440 --> 01:31.650
to be added and actuator rod should also be added from the angular router package and then I'll add

01:31.650 --> 01:39.570
my to object at you relative to configuration and point to this route to my current route.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.490
With that let's see if that works.

01:41.490 --> 01:45.820
Back in the application let's try this new recipe button.

01:45.890 --> 01:47.630
Dad looks great.

01:47.630 --> 01:50.730
So let's try going to just recipe's works.

01:50.750 --> 01:53.060
Select the recipe works too.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.330
So that is indeed working as expected.

01:56.330 --> 02:04.040
Now we should do the same basically for the added recipe though there we also need to pass our ID the

02:04.040 --> 02:10.340
recipe detail component is of course the place where we have distilling either the EDID recipe link

02:10.890 --> 02:15.200
so I'll add a click listener and say on edit recipe here.

02:16.200 --> 02:21.870
Also copy this name into the typescript code off the edit recipe component like this.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.920
And then here we all need to get access to the router so that we can call them navigate method.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.270
So let's inject that type router as before.

02:30.350 --> 02:34.680
Make sure to import the router from at angular router.

02:34.790 --> 02:40.860
And now that is why I stored the ID in this property here with that stored.

02:40.970 --> 02:49.550
I can now use my router here to navigate and I'm one to navigate well basically to the current ID and

02:49.550 --> 02:50.540
then added.

02:50.690 --> 02:56.530
Now I could simply add added to the current route so let's add.

02:56.630 --> 03:00.080
Relative to here this route.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.070
And let's see if this works as expected.

03:03.270 --> 03:09.510
If I click add that recipe we go to zero edit and the same for one.

03:09.510 --> 03:13.410
So actually we don't need the idea here in this case.

03:13.410 --> 03:16.330
Then why did I get it then.

03:16.950 --> 03:24.420
Well simply for demo purposes this is an absolutely fine way and probably the way you will navigate

03:25.200 --> 03:26.910
the alternative though.

03:27.090 --> 03:32.600
And just to show this how that would work into practice this is to use navigate.

03:32.760 --> 03:41.460
And now let's say we move up one level and then we want to add our ID again so this ID and then add

03:41.460 --> 03:41.970
it.

03:42.060 --> 03:49.700
So now I'm deliberately constructing a more complex path simply to show how that would work.

03:49.710 --> 03:54.010
So now that is also relative to our current routes of this route.

03:54.060 --> 03:58.550
And with that you should see that it still works because what we do is we go up one level.

03:58.680 --> 04:05.740
So to just slash recipes in this case then we again add our ID and then added.

04:06.020 --> 04:11.940
And we should see that if I click this button again even if we really want the app to be sure that it

04:11.940 --> 04:15.100
did indeed update it works as before.

04:15.150 --> 04:21.300
Now with a more complex set up again you would probably use the first one which is Welkom and out the

04:21.300 --> 04:22.410
second one.

04:22.470 --> 04:29.040
I just wanted to highlight again how it works how you can use that more complex navigation and also

04:29.040 --> 04:36.780
navigate around with this go up one level command you see here as the first segment of this more complex

04:36.780 --> 04:37.370
POV.

04:37.440 --> 04:44.030
However again just adding added to the relative to the current route I should say is of course the straightforward

04:44.040 --> 04:44.370
way
