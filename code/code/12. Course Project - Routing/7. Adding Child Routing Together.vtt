00:02.260 --> 00:04.170
So where are you successful.

00:04.180 --> 00:06.090
Here is my solution.

00:06.280 --> 00:14.110
As I said I want to implement child routes so I will do this by going to the app routing module here

00:14.740 --> 00:19.080
and on my recipes are add to children property.

00:19.390 --> 00:26.040
Now children also takes an array of routes and each route still is just a javascript object here.

00:26.230 --> 00:33.410
The first rule that want to have is the empty path so that we just wizard slash recipe's slash nothing.

00:33.430 --> 00:40.600
The default case here I want to load that new component was referring to which will simply hold the

00:40.600 --> 00:43.210
text we have in this N-G template for now.

00:43.210 --> 00:47.410
Now for this I will quickly create this component and I'll use the seal.

00:47.410 --> 00:55.450
I've found that with Engy GCI can generate a new component and this component should now go into the

00:55.720 --> 01:00.140
recipe's folders so recipes and then slash.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.780
And here you may simply choose that folder.

01:03.940 --> 01:11.420
So recipes and I will name it recipes start sort of recipes start component with SPAG falls IAP went

01:11.470 --> 01:14.020
this spec file from being generated.

01:14.440 --> 01:18.310
So with that we got our recipes start component here.

01:18.760 --> 01:23.860
And as I mentioned before all it will do is I will output here maybe in a tree tag now.

01:24.070 --> 01:26.540
Please select a recipe.

01:26.560 --> 01:32.310
So really simple with that set up with our start component set up here.

01:32.380 --> 01:34.060
I now want to use that.

01:34.090 --> 01:37.440
It has been added to Marchal automatically by Seelye.

01:37.450 --> 01:39.700
So make sure that this is the case.

01:39.870 --> 01:45.110
And now in the app routing module here I will load this component.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.770
So the recipe start component.

01:48.970 --> 01:49.830
This one here.

01:49.930 --> 01:53.890
Make sure to add the import at the top from dot slash recipes.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.530
Slash recipe starts Shlash recipe start component.

01:57.730 --> 02:03.930
And with that we got our first component which can be displayed inside of our recipes component.

02:04.150 --> 02:10.030
Let's try this out because that be all we need to get started with it in the recipe is component because

02:10.030 --> 02:11.880
again dessous And that's important.

02:11.950 --> 02:17.570
Daises talk about the recipe component here is the component where our child roads are registered.

02:17.680 --> 02:23.470
So it is indice components template that we need to provide a router outlet for the child routes to

02:23.470 --> 02:24.460
be rendered.

02:24.850 --> 02:26.400
So I will do this year.

02:26.530 --> 02:34.710
I will add a router outlet here and when I save this with Engy surf running does looks pretty good.

02:34.720 --> 02:40.710
We simply select a recipe and clearly that is not a paragraph anymore so it seems to be our new component.

02:40.930 --> 02:46.420
Of course if we click somewhere that doesn't work anymore because we only have the router out there

02:46.540 --> 02:50.320
our old logic of loading a recipe is completely broken.

02:50.470 --> 02:52.390
But we will restore it soon.

02:52.390 --> 02:57.210
Actually we can already take the first step for restoring that functionality.

02:57.220 --> 03:01.820
I'll add a number lbf here to the child Rodd's of recipe component.

03:02.410 --> 03:10.050
That path should be Colden ID so a dynamic segment added after slash recipes.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.250
That's of course something you have to keep in mind.

03:12.310 --> 03:17.100
All child routes always come after the path of the parent route.

03:17.140 --> 03:25.600
So all these routes here will have Slash recipes in front of it so add slash or recipes slash ID with

03:25.600 --> 03:38.390
idea being dynamic parameter here I want to load my recipe detail component.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.830
We also need to add to import to that component.

03:40.840 --> 03:41.820
Up here of course.

03:41.830 --> 03:47.970
So from the recipes folder and recipe detail and then the recipe detail the component file with dead.

03:48.190 --> 03:54.250
We now at least have a route which would allow us to load this component and we can kind of see this

03:54.250 --> 03:57.010
in action if we manually enter one here.

03:57.010 --> 04:01.570
Let's say it tries to load the recipe detail component.

04:01.780 --> 04:08.740
Of course it will break because there we try to output data which we no longer get because our old logic

04:08.770 --> 04:14.530
of transferring data from the list item to digital component doesn't work anymore.

04:14.740 --> 04:19.640
But we will fix it and will actually start fixing it in the next lecture.
