In the last lectures we learn how to send post and get requests and we also learn about this response

00:08.200 --> 00:10.950
method here which allows us to unwrap our data.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.080
We get back.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.270
Now this is nice.

00:13.270 --> 00:15.250
We will fine tune this in a second.

00:15.430 --> 00:22.900
Before doing so let's actually go to our service service and exchange the POST method here.

00:23.020 --> 00:30.070
I will actually duplicate it and comment it out let's exchange it with a put request method.

00:30.370 --> 00:31.840
We don't have to change anything else.

00:31.840 --> 00:36.690
Put request also allows us to send some data with the request in the request body.

00:36.700 --> 00:42.400
We target the same your Elum we can even send the same headers but on firebase and this is only related

00:42.400 --> 00:47.780
to firebase year might be different on your back and of course this will lead to a different behavior.

00:47.890 --> 00:52.600
It will now not append our service to object with unique keys.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.910
Instead it will override existing data.

00:56.380 --> 01:03.430
So if I let this app reload and click on Save service now and click on firebase Now you see the old

01:03.430 --> 01:04.180
data is gone.

01:04.180 --> 01:09.630
These unique IDs are gone and we just have 0 and 1 our servers.

01:09.880 --> 01:16.660
And if my reload my app which of course will lead to new IDs since they were recalculated and I click

01:16.660 --> 01:21.400
on Save service again the old service are updated and the ideas are written.

01:21.400 --> 01:25.660
This is what put us so this is how we can use a put request.

01:25.670 --> 01:28.580
And now you solve three requests and action.

01:28.600 --> 01:33.880
This is nice but in the next with you I actually want to have a look at how we can now work with the

01:33.880 --> 01:40.470
data we get back and make this transformation process more convenient using some observables power
