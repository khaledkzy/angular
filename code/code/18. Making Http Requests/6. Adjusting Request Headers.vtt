In the last lecture we send this data to our server.

00:06.070 --> 00:13.750
We implemented this save button here this safe service button and there we basically fire a method in

00:13.750 --> 00:20.200
our service service which generates this observable fluoresce which holds this pre-configured request

00:20.710 --> 00:24.340
and then we send the request by subscribing to that absorbable.

00:24.340 --> 00:32.350
Now of course in your application with your back background there might be the need to send some specific

00:32.350 --> 00:37.720
headers with this request he or I didn't configure any special headers because the default ones are

00:37.720 --> 00:38.710
all I need.

00:38.740 --> 00:46.330
But if you want to send your own headers you can easily do this by generating them with the headers

00:46.420 --> 00:52.880
object angler office you use simply created by eg calling new headers and importing headers from Angle

00:52.880 --> 00:56.410
or HTP and tourist constructor here.

00:56.650 --> 01:03.600
You can pass a javascript object where the key value pairs are the key value pairs of your headers.

01:03.610 --> 01:09.310
For example you could set Content-Type as a string of course because you do have a dash in between which

01:09.310 --> 01:17.010
would be an invalid character without the quotation marks in javascript and could set this to application.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.060
Jason.

01:18.220 --> 01:23.850
Now this is not necessary because it is the default anyways but you can explicitly set it like this

01:23.860 --> 01:26.130
and of course set any other headers too.

01:26.410 --> 01:33.250
And then you can pass those headers by adding a third argument to his post request and actually by adding

01:33.250 --> 01:38.170
this as argument to any of the ABA requests we will have a look at the get request later too.

01:38.590 --> 01:45.210
And there you add a javascript object asty options argument and one of the options are the headers.

01:45.220 --> 01:49.950
So the key here is headers and you will sign your headers object.

01:49.960 --> 01:55.900
I'm just going to split this over multiple lines so that it's easier to read headers referring to our

01:56.100 --> 01:59.820
Hatteras constant here and with that we're sending our own headers.

01:59.920 --> 02:06.700
Again something we do not necessarily need here but what you might need in your setup with your backend

02:07.000 --> 02:13.840
so if we save this and then we simply open up our application again and hit save.

02:14.170 --> 02:19.660
Well what you're going to see is that in the network tag of tab a few inspect your post request year

02:19.900 --> 02:23.520
and the headers you'll see the content type is set to application.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.020
Jason Jason.

02:25.030 --> 02:28.970
Again not necessary but you could send Abre headers too.

02:28.990 --> 02:31.200
This is how you can set headers.

02:31.270 --> 02:32.080
Now with this.

02:32.170 --> 02:36.090
Let's take a closer look at how we can get our data back from the server
